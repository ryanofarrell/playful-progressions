    - text: "<b>Mrs. Maria is an angel on earth!</b> My daughter has dyspraxia and speech apraxia - what Maria did with my daughter's progress in a year is TRULY REMARKABLE!!!! Mrs. Maria is the exact type of person that you want your child to be with because her warmth coupled with her ability to make everything fun - while also learning - is a gift unlike anything I have ever seen! <b>I can not recommend Mrs. Maria enough!</b>"
      name: "Emily & 4yo daughter"
    - text: "As a new mom, <b>I wasn't sure if my baby's development was on track</b>. She hated tummy time and seemed easily overwhelmed by touch. Mrs. Maria helped me understand her sensory needs and gave me simple, loving ways to support her at home. Now our daughter is so much more curious, confident, and engaged in play. Mrs. Maria's calm presence and insight brought real relief — <b>we're so grateful we found her when we did!</b>"
      name: "Sydney & baby girl"
    - text: "<b>Mrs. Maria has been such a gift to our family!!</b> Our son really struggled with transitions and staying focused at school — every day felt like a challenge. Starting in the first session Mrs. Maria built a strong connection with him and gave us tools that actually made a difference. We've seen real progress: mornings are smoother, and he's so much more present in class. <b>Her guidance and compassion have made all the difference, and we're endlessly thankful for her support.</b>"

# FAQ Content (Kept separate as requested)
faq:
  title: "Your Questions Answered"
  subtitle: "Find information about payments, insurance, appointments, and more."
  items:
    - question: "What is your payment process?"
      answer: |
        All payments are securely processed through our HIPAA-compliant payment processor, Jane Payments. When you schedule your child's initial evaluation, you will complete intake forms where you can safely enter your credit card, HSA, or FSA information to be kept on file. Your card will be charged at the time of service.

    - question: "What is your cancellation policy?"
      answer: |
        We understand that life happens, and sometimes plans change! However, because each appointment is reserved just for you, we kindly ask for advance notice if you need to cancel or reschedule. Cancellations made within 48 hours of your appointment will incur a 25% fee, and those made within 24 hours will be charged 50% of the session fee.
        This policy helps us ensure that we can continue providing dedicated care to all the families we serve. We truly appreciate your understanding and cooperation!

    - question: "Do you accept insurance?"
      answer: |
        Insurance & Payment Information
        At Playful Progressions, we are a private-pay practice and do not accept commercial insurance. However, many insurance plans offer reimbursement for services received from an out-of-network provider. We are happy to provide superbills, which you can submit to your insurance company for potential reimbursement.
        Our superbills include the commonly used treatment codes:
        Therapeutic Activity: 97530
        Occupational Therapy Initial Evaluation: 97165, 97166, 97167
        We recommend checking with your insurance provider to understand your out-of-network benefits and reimbursement options. If you have any questions, we're happy to help guide you through the process!

    - question: "Why choose private pay over in-network providers?"
      answer: |
        While using insurance can be a great option, it's important to keep in mind that coverage is often subject to deductibles and coinsurance. We're here to provide high-quality, individualized therapy to support your child's development without unnecessary delays.
        If you have any questions about how we can help, we'd love to chat!

## 2026-02-09 - Loading State for Formspree Forms
**Learning:** Adding a visual loading state (spinner + text change) to Formspree forms significantly improves feedback during the async submission process, which can otherwise feel unresponsive.
**Action:** Apply this pattern (spinner icon + text update + disable button) to all async form submissions in Jekyll/jQuery sites.

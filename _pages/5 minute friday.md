*The first friday of each month, I will take you through an activity that requires less than 5 minutes to set up, and is loaded with benefits for your little one! While I LOVE pinterest and the look of those fancy sensory bins, most of the time they are just not practical, especially for busy moms with busy babies who do not care at all how long the activity took to set up. We have to keep in mind that attention spans are only a few minutes long tops for babies who are months old, so save yourself some time and effort and focus on simplicity. Remember to give yourself some grace.*

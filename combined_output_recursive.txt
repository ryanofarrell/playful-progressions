No matter what way you slice it, feeding a baby is hard. Once your baby is 6 months old (baby’s gut really cannot handle food before then), sitting up unsupported for at least 5 seconds, and has great head control you can start feeding your baby solids. It may feel overwhelming and scary at first to know what and how to feed your baby. The great news is, you do not have to stick with any one program. Find what works best for your baby and run with it. Here are some reasons why I chose to do both baby led weaning and purees.

Baby Led Weaning (BLW) is a method of introducing a variety of foods that the family typically eats. Key components of baby led weaning are that it is self directed, meaning baby feeds themselves whether they are eating whole foods or foods that can be eaten with a spoon. Baby led weaning also introduces foods as a ‘teether’ for babies meaning they are large and therefore reduce the risk of choking. Baby led weaning is fantastic for developing the jaw strength necessary to increase endurance when chewing, encourages lateral tongue movement necessary for moving a bolus of food to one side of the mouth to swallow, and it helps set the stage for normalized dental development. In addition, it is great for babies to learn to use bilateral coordination skills (using both hands together) and bringing hands to the midline to hold food. Admittedly, it can be scary as the baby will gag when learning to handle foods. This is a good thing! It is important to stay calm as babies will feed off of nervous energy. While baby is eating, model chewing, spitting out food and eating. Mealtimes should be fun and stress free. Eventually, the baby will learn how to handle foods and will eat more quantities of food. I love the Solid Starts Food Database to search each food and see how to prepare it for my baby’s age. Solid starts also has a great app where you can track food you’ve tried and track baby’s reaction. I tried it, but ultimately found I didn’t need it (see my blog post about things that changed the game for me postpartum).

Feeding purees can also be beneficial for babies. When feeding purees, I use two spoons. I load one spoon and set it on the high chair tray with the handle facing the baby. Once they pick up the first spoon, I load the second and repeat the process. This allows the baby to improve skills using utensils. In addition, feeding with purees allows babies to play with their food and promotes messy play. Messy play is great for tactile development and encourages the baby to explore several of the properties of food. Feeding purees was also much more comfortable for my caregivers. We are so lucky that my mom and mother-in-law help us out with our baby. They are the most experienced caregivers, but feeding a baby is totally different now. When we were babies they would feed us rice cereal and baby food from a jar. I found it more important to continue introducing foods to my baby even when I could not be there, but I did not want to make it too hard on my baby or caregivers. Lastly, prepping purees is sometimes just easier when you need something quick and prepped and need to get out of the house for daycare. I would buy bags of frozen veggies and steam them or prepare them as directed, then add breastmilk or water to a blender and make the puree. Then, I would freeze the purees into silicone ice cube trays, making it an easy grab and go option. This method also allows grading the texture and leaving some foods chunkier as the baby learns to handle more.

When starting solids, it is important to start introducing water as well. Try using an open cup (we love the tiny cup) and learning to drink through a straw.

It is important to keep feeding your baby as simple as possible for both you and your baby. Enjoy this phase as your baby learns so many new things about their world!

We love a party vibe! Simple latex balloons are fantastic for endless fun for kids of all ages!

## Balloons for Babies

Attach a latex or helium balloon string to your baby's feet while they lie on their back. They'll love looking at the balloon and kicking their legs in excitement! This activity promotes core strength and prepares muscles for milestones like rolling. Plus, it enhances visual tracking, cognition (cause and effect), and attention.

## Balloons for Toddlers

Toddlers adore balloons! Balloons are excellent for motor development at this age. Have your toddler keep the balloon up in the air using their hands to enhance gross motor coordination, visual motor integration, and visual tracking. They can also kick balloons to work on balance, core strength, and gross motor skills.

## Balloons for Big Kids

Balloons can be fantastic for regulation in older children. Blowing up a balloon encourages deep breaths and utilizes oral motor skills for emotional and sensory regulation. Experiment with various props like fly swatters for a fun game of "keep the balloon up" or sit on yoga balls to promote core strength. Challenge your kids by using partially inflated balloons to move small objects like ping pong balls or cotton balls to a finish line. Incorporating challenging positions such as keeping a balloon up while crawling makes reflex integration enjoyable.

Remember, balloons aren't just for decoration! Blow one up if you're looking for a fun way to engage your family!

As a pediatric OT—and a busy mom—I totally get it: sometimes you need screens to get something done. I’m not anti-screen. In fact, my kids watch the occasional show (hello, Ms. Rachel and Bluey!), especially when they’re sick or overtired. But screen time in our house is limited, and there are a few key guidelines I follow:

1. **Bigger Screens Are Better**
Yes, my husband agrees during football season! Watching TV on a larger screen (like a TV) helps avoid the fast-paced, disjointed clips often found on YouTube or phone apps. Unlike our childhood TV experience—where we waited for shows and sat through commercials—kids today can skip and scroll constantly, which fragments attention. Watching full episodes helps build attention span and narrative understanding, which are crucial for learning.

2. **There’s a Time and Place**
Boredom is a gift. It sparks creativity, problem-solving, and independent play. Just like we adults manage to-do lists, kids need opportunities to initiate and follow through with play. I recommend setting limits before the screen goes on: “You can watch one Bluey episode while I do the dishes. Then we’re building a Magnatile tower!” Avoid using screens as a distraction during meals, in restaurants, or at the grocery store. Those real-world experiences help kids process sensory input and build social-emotional skills.

3. **Choose Shows Wisely**
Not all kids' shows are created equal. Fast-paced, overstimulating programs like CoComelon or Hey Bear flood kids with sensory input that real life can’t match. When that becomes the norm, it’s hard for them to engage meaningfully in everyday play. Instead, opt for slower-paced shows with real people or simple storylines—think Sesame Street, Bluey, Little Bear.

4. **Model Healthy Tech Habits**
This one’s tough. Our lives are on our phones—but kids notice. If you're always on your phone, expect them to either fight for your attention or want screen time too. Try starting with screen-free family meals. More importantly, play with your kids. Making eye contact, sharing laughs, and being present goes a long way in building connection and social-emotional skills.

5. **Play Comes First**
At the end of the day, play is how kids learn. Movement, toys, art, and open-ended exploration support development in ways screens can’t. I’ve dedicated my career to understanding this—and I promise even the simplest play can have the biggest impact.

Let's face it, cold and flu season is still upon us! As you stock up on tissues, it's worth knowing that they can serve a purpose beyond wiping runny noses.


## Tissue Box Play for Babies

Encourage your baby to pull tissues out of a tissue box to promote their pincer grasp. Hold the box steady and demonstrate how to pull tissues out. Once the box is empty, repurpose it by filling it with scarves, tissue paper, crinkle paper, or other engaging items to keep your little one entertained.

## Tissue Box Play for Toddlers

Toddlers will also love pulling tissues out of the box. You can also incorporate sequencing by encouraging them to follow up tissue pulling with other tasks, like wiping down a table or engaging in a "snowball fight" by crumpling tissues and tossing them into a container. These activities help improve upper extremity strength and proprioceptive processing, as well as fine motor coordination and bilateral coordination.

## Tissue Box Play for Older Kids
For older kids, consider creating smaller holes in the sides of the tissue box to place small items such as toothpicks or cotton swabs inside. Make the holes just big enough for the objects to fit partially through to promote fine motor strength. You can also enhance visual motor skills by creating patterns or designs with the objects, or use thumb tacks to trace a design you create. For an added challenge, have your older child place golf tees on the sides of the box and balance small objects like marbles, tiny erasers, or candies on top. This activity improves fine motor precision and helps develop the tripod grasp (essential for pencil grasp).

As we near the end of cold and flu season, you may find yourself with a surplus of tissue boxes. Why not repurpose them for these engaging activities? After all, a little fun amidst the nose-wiping can make the season more bearable for everyone!

It is never a bad idea to practice using a backpack! Backpacks are not just for school aged kids and are packed with several benefits beyond hauling your stuff!  Prepare for back-to-school with a backpack focused 5-minute Friday!

- Backpacks are amazing to practice zippers!  Using a backpack is a great way to introduce the grasp pattern (lateral pinch) used for zippers.  Typically, backpacks have a variety of zippers to work with and explore.  The sooner you introduce zippers, the sooner your child will be able to manage their backpack, lunch box, and coat!
- Stuffing a backpack with a blanket, toys, stuffed animals, anything really and having your child walk around with it is a great way to get in some ‘heavy work’ and provide the proprioceptive input they need to regulate.  Much like we find relief with a weighted blanket, your kiddos will feel more grounded doing some heavy work tasks.
- Backpacks also provide a great opportunity for babies, toddlers, and bigger kids to problem solve through putting objects inside, and taking them out.  This skill requires visual motor integration, bilateral coordination, strength, and refined fine motor skills.
- For older kiddos, using a backpack to facilitate organizational strategies is also very helpful!  Showing your child how the backpack can become big and bulky with items organized in one way, and more streamlined another way is a great way to facilitate visual spatial skill development and problem solving skills.  Organization is a very important executive functioning skill for school age kids!
- Typically, backpacks are loaded with pockets!  Placing small toys, pencils, snacks in the pockets are a great way to promote fine motor development, stereognosis, bilateral coordination and problem solving skills.  Removing the objects and placing objects each have equal benefits
- Practicing putting on and taking off a backpack also helps facilitate body awareness and pre-dressing skills by way of placing arms through the holes.  It is a great starter activity for tasks like putting on a jacket.

With back to school just around the corner, it's a great time to use that new backpack for play and development opportunities!

Straws are such a great go-to that I always carry in my therapy bag! They’re inexpensive, versatile, and effective for all ages! Here are a few things you can entertain your kiddos with using straws!

### Did you know that babies can start drinking from a straw cup early?

Introducing a straw cup when starting solids is a great way to support oral motor development and begin water intake alongside food. One of my favorites for beginners is the **Honey Bear Cup** 🐻. It has a flexible straw and a squeezable bottle, making it easier for little ones to learn how to drink from a straw.

I also love using silicone straws as teethers. Their long, stick-like design is perfect for mouthing and helps babies build jaw strength. You can even add a thin layer of nut butter (like peanut butter for early allergen introduction) or a bit of puree to encourage tongue lateralization—an important skill for feeding.

### Straws for Toddlers

Straws aren’t just for drinking—they’re versatile therapy tools too!

*   **✂️ Scissor practice:** Plastic straws are the perfect size and firmness for learning to snip. After cutting, the pieces can be used for stringing activities that build fine motor coordination, bilateral coordination, and visual motor skills.

*   **🔺 Shape building:** Those cut pieces can also be arranged into shapes, letters, or numbers for a fun, multisensory approach to pre-writing.

*   **💨 Oral motor play:** Place a cotton ball on the floor and have a race by blowing it with a straw. Add crawling into the mix, and you’ve got a great reflex integration activity too!

*   **🔧 Fine motor strengthening:** Try bending a straw into makeshift tongs—kids love the novelty, and it’s great for grasp development.

### Straws for Bigger Kids

Straws continue to be useful as children grow:

*   **🌬️ Bubble mountain:** Fill a bowl with water and a drop of soap, then blow through a straw to make a mountain of bubbles (just remind your child not to sip!). This activity strengthens oral motor skills, supports deep breathing for regulation, and encourages visual gaze.

*   **👀 Eye-hand coordination:** Hold a straw in your mouth, focus on the tip, and place small objects (like toothpicks) inside. This challenges both fine motor control and oculomotor skills, specifically convergence.

*   **🥤 Sensory support:** For sensory seekers, try sipping thick liquids (like smoothies or milkshakes) through a straw, or use a thinner straw (like a coffee stirrer) for water. Both options provide oral sensory input that can be calming and organizing.

### Final Thought

Straws are inexpensive, versatile, and easy to find—so grab a pack on your next trip to the dollar store and enjoy all the fun (and skill-building) they have to offer!

I love every one of my patients. I have been in the same clinic for almost six years now, and have developed a strong relationship with so many families. I remember thinking, “is it possible that I will love my baby as much (or more) than these kids?” The answer is yes, because having your own child is SO different. If I’m being honest, I have felt a little imposter syndrome as my job requires me to provide parenting advice; without the experience of ever having parented. While I thought I would be able to feel more confident about my recommendations after having my own child, my practice changed in so many more unexpected ways.

1. **Babies and Kids are not robots** - Of course I have always known this, but prior to having my own baby, I would make recommendations that were strictly textbook evidenced based information. This is still best practice, but I understand more than ever that sometimes, following the book is just not possible for some kids. We cannot expect them to follow all of the rules, even if the parent is doing it all according to plan. I am much more flexible with my thoughts about how to make suggestions work for each specific family. While there is always a “best choice” that may work for most, every child deserves their own plan.
2. **I provide clear answers** - Prior to being on the patient side of OT, I would leave too much up to the family, especially when the reason for seeking OT was not “severe” in my opinion. For example, when I would have the rare OT evaluation where the child could benefit from OT, but would likely be okay without it, I would leave the decision to start treatment up to the family. Now, I know that seeking professional help is not easy. With the millions of “experts” on Tik Tok, families are looking for someone they can trust to provide them with clear answers. I am careful to explain functional deficits that I am noticing and how it may affect the child's future, what my recommendation is (whether or not to start services), what those services will look like, and what will be expected of the family both in treatment and at home.
3. **I am an empathetic provider** - I have always been sympathetic to my patient families. Empathy is much different. After Keely had a tongue tie release (something that I had previously seen as not a big deal at all), I realized that having to get extra help for your child is so hard, vulnerable, and actually a big deal no matter the deficit. I am able to better understand how it feels to want to and need to go above and beyond for your child.
4. **I can ask the hard questions** - I have always found it challenging to ask uncomfortable questions to get more information. Now, I know how important the little things are to a treatment plan, from family history to home life to other diagnoses. I understand that sometimes, families don’t even know where to look if there is a deficit, and I can point them in the right direction. Knowing if a family has tried genetic diagnostic testing, or visited a neuropsychologist can be helpful in guiding my treatment. If the family has never considered these options, giving them the tools and information they need to better understand their child is so important and valuable.
5. **I use a family based approach** - Each family is different. They have different routines, different structures, and different parts of their day are important to them. When making recommendations for home programs, I ask more questions about what parts of their day are most important to them, and find a way to incorporate home programming that is both convenient, and allows continuation of the most important parts of their day. For us, having breakfast as a family and “tender time” before bed together are the most important times of our day and bring us the most joy. Knowing this information about my clients would allow me to suggest incorporating home programming into these times, or avoid them completely. Families need to have a life outside of therapy, and that is okay.

## What is a Tongue Tie?

Tongue ties have become a hot-button issue lately, yet many remain unfamiliar with what they entail or how to recognize them. Essentially, a tongue tie occurs when excess tissue tethers the tongue to the floor of the mouth, either anteriorly (at the front) or posteriorly (in the middle). Typically, accompanying a tongue tie, you might observe a lip or buccal (cheek) tie. Unlike most muscles in the body, the tongue lacks clear insertion points. When a tie occurs, the tongue forms an attachment to the hyoid bone, leading to difficulties in feeding, maintaining proper tongue posture for nasal breathing, and increased overall body tension, among other functional deficits. Essentially, tightness in the mouth from a tongue tie can have widespread effects on the entire body due to the interconnectedness of fascia from head to toe.

## How I Knew My Kids Were Tongue-Tied

With my first baby, latching was incredibly challenging. We resorted to using formula to coax her onto the breast, and even then, each feeding session took almost an hour. She frequently fell asleep mid-feed, prompting us to employ various tactics to keep her awake and feeding. Despite our efforts, she struggled to gain weight and seemed consistently uncomfortable. Although my pediatrician confirmed my suspicions and promptly referred us to a lactation consultant, it’s worth noting that tongue ties are often overlooked by pediatricians. Thus, being aware of symptoms associated with tongue ties can empower parents to recognize and identify them. Both of my children also had significant lip ties, which are typically easier to spot by flipping the top lip upward to reveal a thick band of connective tissue attaching the lip to the gum line. Recognizing the significance of the lip ties, I suspected a tongue tie was also present. If unsure, specially trained professionals such as lactation consultants, speech language pathologists, occupational therapists, and dentists can assist in identification.

My second baby’s experience was markedly different. She latched immediately after birth and was gaining weight satisfactorily. However, her tight lip tie was noticeable as her upper lip would appear taut after feeds. My main concern, however, was the tension she exhibited, evident by red lines under her neck, closed fists, and a preference for turning her head to the right. Drawing from my experience treating babies with similar issues, I attempted to alleviate her tension, but progress was limited. Despite being able to feed relatively well and appearing generally content, she still displayed symptoms such as milk loss during feeds, preference for one side over the other, tongue clicking, limited milk transfer from the breast, and milk residue on her tongue and cheeks. After several visits to speech therapy and consultations with lactation specialists, I made the decision to proceed with the release.

## Therapies and Preparation

Tongue tie releases are not a straightforward solution. Both of my daughters began therapy, including speech and occupational therapy, before they were two weeks old. These sessions involved bodywork and oral motor strengthening programs aimed at enhancing coordination and strength in oral motor skills. Additionally, we sought assistance from a chiropractor and craniosacral therapist. These therapies are crucial before releasing a tongue tie for several reasons. Babies develop swallowing abilities as early as 12 weeks in utero, meaning they’ve already developed compensatory strategies. Through neuromuscular reeducation, these professionals help ensure that the baby is prepared for the release and can use their tongue effectively afterward. Furthermore, not all tongue ties necessitate release, hence the importance of determining whether it’s warranted. Pre-release bodywork helps identify whether tension is solely due to the ties or other factors like positioning in utero or the birthing process. Releasing tension before the frenectomy not only aids in optimizing the results of the release but also assists in wound healing. While tension is common in babies after birth, both of my daughters exhibited tension beyond their initial weeks of life that couldn’t be fully addressed through professional intervention alone. Improvement in oral motor function might also render releases unnecessary. Hence, symptoms for both the mother (if breastfeeding) and the baby should be closely monitored.

## Deciding to Get the Release

After seeking help from multiple professionals, I decided to proceed with the release for both of my daughters because they continued to struggle with feeding and muscle tension. Although therapy improved these issues to some extent, it wasn’t sufficient for long-term functioning. My older daughter still experienced reflux and fed slowly, while my younger daughter fatigued easily, requiring frequent feeding. Additionally, her tension and head turn preference were concerning, potentially leading to plagiocephaly or torticollis. Beyond their immediate needs, I recognized that untreated tongue ties could result in lifelong issues, including migraines, TMJ, sleep disturbances, and head and neck tension.

## After-Release Care

The release is just the beginning of the journey. Stretching the wound every four hours is vital to prevent reattachment. This stretching regimen must be maintained day and night. Furthermore, oral motor and bodywork must continue to ensure optimal results and facilitate the baby’s ability to use their tongue effectively and build necessary strength. Both of my daughters coped well with their releases and were able to feed immediately afterward. While my older daughter fed more effectively and quickly post-release, my younger daughter struggled with organizing her suck and displayed significant weakness. However, through continued speech therapy, she made remarkable progress within two weeks, with even more improvement evident four weeks post-release. Despite initial challenges with her oral motor skills, her tension notably decreased post-release. Just one day after the release, the red lines under her neck disappeared, and her fists relaxed. We continued with diligent bodywork and neck stretching to prevent torticollis and eliminate her head turn preference, eventually leading to her discharge from speech therapy four weeks post-release. We still see a chiropractor regularly to manage tension and ensure symmetry.

## Would I Do It Again?

Elective surgery decisions are undoubtedly difficult for any parent. However, having undergone two successful frenectomies, I would unquestionably make the same decision again. Understanding the ongoing work required to optimize the release and acknowledging that it’s not a quick fix, I’m confident that addressing my daughters’ tongue ties early has led to significant improvements in their oral motor skills and motor coordination. My youngest daughter, now four months old, is thriving during bottle feeds, and I have peace of mind knowing she can eat well under alternate caregivers while I work. Moreover, she’s meeting gross motor milestones more effectively and is progressing well with tummy time. Though the journey has been challenging, it has been undeniably worth every step.

Q-tips are a bathroom staple, but can also be used to develop so many skills for kids of all ages!  The best news– minimal set up and clean up!

## Babies
- Q-tips are a great way to facilitate developing grasp patterns in babies.  Set out a few in front of the baby and encourage them to pick them up using a raking grasp.  Once your baby is around 9 months old, it is appropriate to set just one out at a time to facilitate a pincer grasp.
- Once the baby has mastered picking up the q-tips, it is time to start working on releasing them!  Place a small box or wide mouth bottle in front of them, and demonstrate releasing the q-tips into the containers.  This addresses visual motor integration and fine motor skills, and sets the foundation for cleaning up!

## Toddlers
- By toddlerhood, your child should have more refined elbow, wrist and hand control making it easier for them to drop q-tips into smaller openings such as a plastic bottle.  You can even try poking holes into an old cereal box to create some resistance, and have your toddler push q-tips into the holes.  This is great for addressing grading force, fine motor coordination, and facilitating pincer and tripod grasp patterns
- Taping 4+ q-tips together creates a great paint brush, just like a dot dauber.  Using paint provides a multisensory approach and is a great way to introduce pre-writing strokes (horizontal and vertical lines, + and a circle)

## Big Kids
- Q-tips are easily bent and can be formed into straight lines and curves and used to build letters.  This is a great kinesthetic approach to learning letter formation and letter recognition.  Remember, drawing shapes comes before letters, so forming squares, circles and triangles can be great for pre-writing and developing visual motor integration skills
- Taping 3 q-tips together and using them to write in paint, sand, shaving cream, etc is a great way to facilitate developing a tripod grasp

Using q-tips are not just for grooming!  They are a great asset to developing fine motor skills for all ages!

It’s that time of year again! I can still remember the excitement of picking out school supplies and planning the perfect first-day outfit. But I also remember feeling overwhelmed and anxious about all the new things that come with a fresh school year.

Back-to-school transitions can be especially challenging for children with sensory differences. In previous years, they may have felt comfortable with their teachers, learned routines, and even begun to self-advocate. But starting a new school year means navigating unfamiliar environments, expectations, and sensory input—something that’s particularly tough for kids with sensory processing challenges.

To help ease the transition, it’s important for parents and teachers to stay mindful of what these children might be facing. Here are a few helpful tips from an occupational therapist to support a smoother back-to-school experience:

### 1. Start the Routine Early
Mornings can be tricky for children with sensory or executive functioning challenges. A week or so before school starts, try doing a “dress rehearsal” of your morning routine. Practice waking up, getting dressed, and going through grooming and breakfast routines at the same time each day.

**Helpful ideas:**
* Lay out clothes the night before.
* Use a checklist or visual schedule for grooming and dressing.
* Time how long each step takes to minimize surprises and morning stress.

### 2. Have a Sensory-Based Plan
Integrating sensory strategies into morning and afternoon routines can help regulate energy and mood.

In the morning, kids (and adults!) often need help waking up their bodies and sensory systems. Try incorporating movement-based activities like:
* Animal walks to the bathroom,
* Skipping to the breakfast table,
* Cross-lateral movements like windmills or cross crawls,
* Jumping or hopping instead of walking during transitions.

For example, do cross crawls as a family before sitting down to eat, or hop to the car instead of walking!

### 3. Manage Expectations
Uncertainty can be anxiety-provoking. Help your child feel more prepared by gathering as much information as possible before school starts:
* Who is the teacher?
* Who is in the class?
* What will the daily schedule look like?

Talk through the information using pictures or drawings and discuss what to expect. Even better if you can visit the classroom and teacher beforehand. This can ease anxiety during the first few days of school.

### 4. Prepare for a “Cool Down” After School
It's natural for parents to want to ask, “How was your day?” the moment kids get in the car—but that can feel overwhelming after a long, overstimulating day.

Instead, consider creating a "car kit" filled with sensory-friendly items your child can use on the way home. Use a small travel toiletry bag and fill it with things like:
* Putty or fidgets,
* Chewy tubes,
* Soft textured items.

Keep conversation minimal, and try playing calming music. Once home, offer access to a sensory space or calm-down corner to let your child decompress in a safe and familiar environment.

### 5. Continue Sensory Support into the Bedtime Routine
A restful night’s sleep is key to regulation the next day. Help prepare your child’s nervous system for rest with calming sensory input, such as:
* A warm bath,
* Soft blankets or weighted lap pads,
* Deep pressure massage,
* Dim lighting and calming music.

You can also reduce morning stress by packing lunches and laying out clothes the night before.

--------

Wishing you and your child a smooth start to the school year! Implementing sensory strategies throughout the day can ease the transition for both children and parents—and set the tone for a successful year ahead.

It’s hard to believe that almost three years ago we were ‘forced’ to switch to teletherapy for occupational therapy services. Today, we are still providing teletherapy; but this method of treatment is anything but forced. There are several unique benefits of doing occupational therapy through telehealth.

1. **Convenience** - This may be the most obvious of all benefits, but you cannot deny that teletherapy is so convenient! Getting your child from school, home, other extracurriculars to therapy can be a chore. You have to consider transitioning times, traffic, and juggling multiple schedules to get to and from therapy, and oftentimes the whole day revolves around one 30-minute session. Occupational therapy can be even more beneficial and you can dedicate more time to continued work on functional skills by buying back some of that precious time spent in the car.
2. **Using Materials at Home Increases Opportunities for Replication** - Each week, I send my clients a list of household items to have ready for their therapy session. This is an excellent opportunity for parents to learn the therapeutic benefits of objects they already have (Who knew how many fine motor skills can be addressed with a single piece of printer paper?). Furthermore, it allows the session to be targeted to the clients unique interests. If a child has a preferred toy, we use it in sessions and provide new ways to play with it to increase therapeutic value and skill building. It also allows parents to replicate OT sessions and reinforce targeted skills outside of OT. Furthermore, children are more likely to engage in therapeutic tasks independently because they have all of the necessary materials available to them at all times.
3. **Increased Parent Education Opportunities** - Teletherapy sessions provide the unique opportunity for open dialogue throughout the session between the provider and parents. Parents can ask questions and receive undivided attention from the therapist. In addition, when working on hands-on tasks, parents are able to carry out the suggested intervention with the therapist’s guidance. This increases parent confidence and follow through with home programs.
4. **Ability to Alter the Environment** - During teletherapy sessions, the therapist has the unique opportunity to make suggestions to alter the home environment for increased success in functional skills. For example, when addressing self feeding, the therapist is able to make suggestions about seating using the table, chairs, high chair, etc. that you have. We can also make suggestions regarding specific utensils to use. When addressing strengthening, the therapist can make suggestions using toys, furniture or specific spaces in your house to facilitate strengthening and positioning interventions. Therapists can also make suggestions regarding sensory strategies and adaptations to make around the home to assist in regulation.
5. **Maximizing Time** - Providing teletherapy services also maximizes the time spent engaging in therapeutic activity. We are able to cut out transitions into sessions including unplanned bathroom breaks. We can eliminate transition time out of the session and the possibility of taking a little too long to make the ever important choice on a flavor of lollipop. Teletherapy allows us to focus on direct targeted intervention for the duration of the session.

Let’s talk about one of the most underrated (and under-the-sink!) tools for child development—sponges! If you’re anything like me, dishes are a regular part of the day. And guess what? Kids love to mimic what they see! So why not turn that everyday item into a sensory-rich, skill-building activity?

Whether you have a baby just learning to grasp or a big kid looking for a creative challenge, sponges can provide endless opportunities for play and development.

## Sponges for Babies

Babies are all about exploring the world with their hands (and mouths!). Try these sponge ideas:

- **Grasp & Reach Practice:** Cut a sponge into long strips to encourage a palmar grasp—the same movement babies use to bring things to their mouths. Great for early hand development!
- **Core strengthening Practice:** Get a sponge wet and stick it to a mirror or glass door just out of your baby's reach. Encourage them to sit, reach and grab the sponge from the vertical surface. If your baby has mastered sitting, try it in a tall kneeling position for even more strengthening benefits!
- **Sensory Tummy Time:** Create a mini water world! Add a little water to a cookie sheet, toss in some chunky sponge pieces, and let your baby explore during tummy time. It's soft, safe, and oh-so-engaging.

## Sponges for Toddlers

Toddlers thrive with hands-on learning. Try these sponge games to support motor skills, sensory play, and early learning:

- **Sponge Puzzle:** Cut a shape out of a sponge and have your child match it with the missing piece. This simple game supports form constancy, visual-motor integration, and problem-solving.
- **Matching Game:** Cut sponges in half and draw shapes, letters, or colors on them. Set up an obstacle course where your toddler finds and matches the pairs. Perfect for pre-writing skills and visual perception!
- **Squeeze Game:** Have your child soak up water with a sponge and squeeze it into a clear cup. Measure how much they squeeze—great for fine motor strength and fun competition.
- **Sponge Towers:** Stack sponges to build towers! This encourages fine motor coordination, spatial awareness, and patience.
- **Crawling Challenges:** Place a sponge under your child’s chin or on their back and have them crawl across the room. It’s silly fun that helps integrate reflexes like ATNR and STNR!
- **Chore Time = Sensory Time:** Let your toddler help wash the car or wipe tables with a sponge. These activities offer proprioceptive input while giving you a helping hand—win-win!

## Sponges for Bigger Kids

Big kids can still get in on the sponge fun with more complex activities that build strength, creativity, and coordination:

- **Mega Squeeze Challenge:** Strengthen fine motor muscles by squeezing sponges into measuring cups—set goals and make it a game!
- **Obstacle Course:** Use sponges as “stepping stones” in a balance course to work on coordination and core strength.
- **Creative Play Scenes:** Build a sponge playscape for cars, animals, or figurines. This encourages executive functioning and imaginative play—all while having a blast.

## Final Splash

Sponges might seem simple, but they’re a powerhouse for development. They’re soft, safe, and versatile enough for kids of all ages. Whether you’re working on motor skills, sensory processing, or creative play—sponges have you covered.

So go ahead—grab a few, get messy, and have fun!

Feeling overwhelmed by the sight of a laundry basket? Let's face it, laundry seems to be a never-ending task! In this edition of 5-Minute Friday, we'll explore some creative ways to turn your laundry basket into a fun activity for both you and your little one!


## Heavy Work Benefits

Laundry baskets offer fantastic opportunities for heavy work activities at any age! Heavy work is renowned for providing proprioceptive input, crucial for self-regulation. Encourage your kids to pack a laundry basket with their favorite stuffed animals, blankets, and toys. The act of lifting and transporting these items provides excellent heavy work benefits. For younger ones, placing them in the laundry basket with toys can be both stimulating and enjoyable. Additionally, they can push or pull the basket, enhancing their motor skills. For older children, lifting the laundry basket itself provides a great proprioceptive workout.

## Vestibular Processing Benefits

Did you know that laundry baskets can double as makeshift vehicles? Place your child inside and gently push or pull them around the room. Add pillows or blankets for extra comfort and support. This activity not only provides vestibular input but also offers a fun sensory experience.

## Core Strengthening Benefits

Sitting in a moving laundry basket is an excellent way to improve core strength. Alternatively, use an upside-down laundry basket as a platform for your child to play on. This encourages them to maintain balance and engage their core muscles. For added difficulty, have your toddler kneel on a pillow while playing, adding an extra challenge to their core engagement.

## Fine Motor Benefits

Laundry baskets have holes that can be utilized for fine motor activities. Attach items like rubber bands, exercise bands, or party beads to these holes for your little one to manipulate. You can also tape a coloring page to the inside of the laundry basket, providing a unique drawing station. Not only does this keep them entertained in a safe space, but it also promotes optimal wrist extension and increases shoulder strength by utilizing a vertical surface.

By incorporating these activities, you can transform your laundry basket into a preferred play space for you and your child. Here's to making laundry time a little more enjoyable!

Muffin tins are for more than just baking delicious treats!  (Although involving kids in baking is an excellent task that highlights many skills!)  They are great for developing several stable skills for babies- big kids!  There is something about playing with a kitchen toy that is really motivating!

## Babies
- Use your muffin tin to facilitate grasping patterns.  Place small toys inside each pocket and allow them to practice arm, wrist and hand control to pull objects out. This is great for developing visual motor integration and raking grasp patterns
- Place different textures in a few pockets for an easy DIY sensory bin!  Try different purees because mouthing is a real, developmentally appropriate thing!  
Using a muffin tray and hard toys such as marbles inside can also make a great noise maker.  Simply shake it up to entertain baby during tummy time!

## Toddlers
- Using a muffin tray is a great way to introduce and practice using a spoon.  The sides of each pocket help provide additional assistance when scooping.  Remember to have your child hold the tray still with their ‘helper’ hand.
- Using a mini muffin tray is great for placing small objects inside for refinding fine motor skills and grasp patterns.  Have them pick up small toys with their thumb, index and middle fingers to facilitate a tripod grasp
- Muffin trays are great for sorting! Use different colored pom poms or a similar toy to sort by row or column.  Use a spoon to sort for bonus scooping practice

## Big Kids
- Use muffin trays and small toys (something the size of a marble) to work on in hand manipulation skills like palm to finger translation (holding a few marbles at a time and bringing one from the palm into the thumb and index finger and releasing into each pocket), finger to palm translation (picking up a few small objects from a pocket, and moving them from the fingers to palms)
- Use muffin trays to practice organizational skills and executive functioning skills by sorting from smallest to largest, by color, or by different properties.
- Using muffin trays to pour liquids in can help facilitate an understanding of volume (how much is too much), bilateral coordination to stabilize a muffin tin while pouring liquid from a cup or measuring cup, and self care skills to improve ability to accurately pour oneself a drink

Muffin trays are always a go-to in the clinic, and can be so much fun at home for all ages!

Most new parents have heard of tummy time, and know that their baby should be doing tummy time; however, no one ever explains why tummy time is so important!   In reality, the benefits of tummy time are endless, and can be even more important for babies with tethered oral tissues (TOTs- tongue ties, lip ties, buccal ties).  Here are some of the highlights:

1. **Oral motor skill improvement** - Tummy Time is essential to stretch the hypoglossal (tongue) and neck muscles necessary for improved oral motor skills.  The tongue is the only muscle in the body that does not have an insertion point (unless there is a tongue tie present).  The tongue originates in the hyoid bone in the neck.  In order to have full tongue mobility, the neck must stretch so that the tongue can reach full range of motion.  This is essential for feeding skills like when we use our tongue to move a bolus of food to our molars to chew and to the back of our palate to swallow.  In addition, the tongue assumes optimal positioning in the palate in tummy time and is an excellent way to improve sucking strength for more efficient feeding.
2. **Extension position** -  Babies spend so much time in flexion in the womb.   When they join us earthside, they are often in a scrunched position.  Spending time on the belly helps to elongate the extensor muscles and activate muscles that have not been used.  This will help babies adapt to their new world and achieve appropriate positioning.
3. **Increases core, shoulder girdle, and neck strength** -  Tummy time improves overall strength in the core, shoulders and neck.  Fine motor skill development starts proximally with core and shoulder strength, and moves distally once strength is developed.  Therefore, strength is essential to future fine motor coordination and control.  In addition,strengthening the core and neck is essential for digestive processes.  This is why tummy time is very helpful for babies with reflux. 
4. **Gross motor development** -  Tummy time provides foundational skills and strengthening needed to meet gross motor milestones such as rolling, sitting, transitioning and crawling.  In moving through these developmental stages, babies integrate their primitive reflexes.  Children who have retained their primitive reflexes experience interference with biochemical, psycho-emotional, and neurological development.
5. **Vision and oculomotor skill development** - Tummy time improves vision and the ability for both eyes to work together (oculomotor skills).  In the prone position, both eyes are working together and learning to move together.  These oculomotor skills are essential for developing depth perception, as well as developing visual saccades and visual tracking skills necessary for hand-eye coordination and future reading skills.
6. **Improves fine motor skills** - in addition to strengthening the proximal musculature in the core and shoulder girdle as a foundation for fine motor skill development, tummy time promotes reaching and grasping skills resulting in improved upper extremity control, coordination and fine motor precision. 
7. **Indirectly improves head shape** - with the introduction of ‘back to sleep,’ babies are spending more and more time on their backs.  Although this is the safest way to sleep (and definitely recommended) we are seeing more cases of torticollis (tight neck muscles) and plagiocephaly (head flattening).  Tummy time will improve and stretch the tight neck muscles associated with torticollis therefore reducing head turn preferences and head tilt that leads to head flattening.  In addition, tummy time will allow for time spent off of the head to improve head shape.

## Tummy Time FAQ
In treating infants, I have come across these commonly asked questions about tummy time

***Q**: How much tummy time should we do?*

**A**: This really depends on the baby’s tolerance for tummy time.  If your baby hates tummy time and screams, they are likely experiencing tension and getting very uncomfortable in tummy time.  There are a few tricks to make tummy time more tolerable; however, it does get easier as they gain more strength.  As a general rule, spending some time in tummy time 3x per day is my recommendation.  Sometimes the baby will tolerate longer stretches, sometimes they will not, which is why I do not recommend a set time.  My daughter needed a cumulative 15 minutes of tummy time each wake window if she was going to nap at all, so part of the recommendation is based on what the baby needs.  

***Q**: When can we start tummy time?*

**A**: You can start tummy time as soon as your baby enters the world!  Tummy time lying on a parents chest counts, and skin-to-skin contact has endless benefits.  It is important to ensure some tummy time is spent on the floor, and many people like to wait until the umbilical cord falls out to do this, but it is not entirely necessary.  Do what you are comfortable with!

***Q**: What if my baby falls asleep in tummy time?*

**A**: I love a SUPERVISED tummy time nap!  It still provides all of the benefits!  Your baby can nap in tummy time as long as you are watching them and their airway is not obstructed.  Placing your baby back to sleep for naps and for night sleep is still recommended if they are in their crib or bassinet and if you are not able to watch them closely.

***Q**: What are some tummy time tips?*

**A**: I have several tips and love working with families to determine what their babies respond best to.  Here are some of my go-tos
- Make sure the baby is ready for tummy time.  Try an infant massage to warm them up so that they enter tummy time in a regulated state
- Place the baby in a supported seated position first, then slowly lower them down to their backs, tuck an arm under, and roll into tummy time.  This helps baby understand their body positioning and provides a much more gentle transition than simply placing them on their tummy
- Provide manual feedback.  Babies love movement, providing a gentle rocking motion by placing your hand on their behind and gently moving them goes a long way.  In addition, any movement should start at the head and arms, squirmy legs are a sign of compensation.  Try gently holding the legs still or placing your leg behind their feet for feedback
- Tuck their arms under their shoulders.  Babies do not have full control over their upper extremities in the beginning and just do not know what to do with their arms.  They will be more comfortable with their arms tucked.  As they get older, this position will also encourage them to lift their heads.
- Keep it interesting!  Use high contrast cards, books, light up toys, rattles, your voice, etc. to entertain your baby during tummy time.  I am not a huge fan of buying everything you can, but I am a huge fan of using whatever you have around the house to keep it novel (think noise making kitchen staples, a pet, etc.)

***Q**: When should I seek help?*

**A**: Tummy time will ebb and flow.  Some sessions will be great and some sessions will not be the best and that is okay.  If your baby is unable to tolerate any tummy time, it may be a good idea to reach out to an experienced OT or PT as there may be an underlying issue such as tension, tethered oral tissues, or torticollis at play.  It is always a good idea to seek treatment from an OT or PT if your baby has tethered oral tissues or is getting a release to complete necessary bodywork strategies for optimal results.

During a typical evaluation, I will ask parents the client’s pregnancy and birth history. Questions include whether there were prenatal or birth complications, if the child was born more than 2 weeks early or two weeks late, and if they required time in the NICU prior to discharge. While all of this information is important and pertinent to care, I am most excited about the extra information I get. Like when a mother will tell me how her baby was positioned in the womb and how it affected their movement as a newborn. Or when a mother tells me their child hated when she wore tight clothing, and are now very avoidant to any and all types of sensory input. I wholeheartedly believe that paying attention to our baby’s movement and patterns in utero can clue us in to their behaviors after birth.

When explaining sensory processing, I often start by explaining that there are three primitive senses that are formed first in utero: proprioception, tactile, and vestibular processing. These sensations are formed in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus, and amygdala. Also known as the limbic system. The first of these sensations is the vestibular system. The vestibular sense is our ability to interpret movement and head position, so you know I was pumped when my baby was head down at 32 weeks. It is also integral in oculomotor development (visual skills) and auditory processing skills. Throughout gestational development, exercising, talking to your baby, and listening to music can help develop this system.

While uterine development is important, the baby will develop thousands of synapses in the brain through the first weeks and months of life. This is why movement is key for your littles. Rolling from side to side while changing diapers, dancing while holding your baby, and baby wearing are all ways to promote vestibular development. As your baby develops, you will literally be able to see the vestibular system at work, such as when your baby gains head control and learns to sit up against gravity.

Proprioception is the way our muscles, tendons and joints work together to tell us where our body is in space. It is very important for body awareness and motor development. In utero, our babies are given constant proprioception by squeezing into that tiny space, a womb. They kick and punch (and we feel it!) against the uterine walls and receive so much input and information about their bodies. Providing proprioception is calming for most people and babies. It is essential for babies to grow and develop muscle tone. Our babies are seeking proprioception naturally through development, like when they finally learn to push up on their hands during tummy-time and when they kick their feet against their toys.

Tactile processing is so important for our babies to grow and understand their environments. It is essential in developing fine motor skills. Like proprioception and vestibular input, our babies are privy to endless tactile input in utero. Once they are a few months old, they attempt to reach and grasp for objects and bring them straight to their mouths where the sensation is more intense and gives babies more information about what they are feeling. Mouthing toys becomes essential for developing oral motor skills necessary for eating later on.

Sensory development is so important for motor development, regulation and understanding our environment. It starts in the womb and continues throughout the lifespan. Providing foundational sensory processing skills is essential for infant development.

Pom poms (or cotton balls!) are soft, colorful, and full of developmental potential. These tiny tools can support sensory, fine motor, and visual skills — and every activity takes less than 5 minutes to set up!

------

## Pom Poms for Babies

**Sensory exploration:** Gently rub pom poms along your baby’s arms, hands, legs, and especially feet. This helps them process touch sensations and build tolerance for different textures.

**Feeding foundations:** Lightly brushing the cheeks and corners of the mouth can help integrate the rooting reflex — an important step for developing feeding skills.

**Pom Pom Rescue:** Place pom poms in a muffin tin and let your baby grab them out. This supports early grasp development and problem solving. To make it harder, cover a few sections with tape!

------

## Pom Poms for Toddlers

**Tongs & sorting:** Use tongs to pick up and sort pom poms by color or size. Great for emerging grasp patterns, early scissor skills, and cognitive growth.

**Blow race:** Blow pom poms across a table or floor using a straw (or just your breath!) to strengthen oral motor and visual tracking skills.

**Pom Pom Rescue 2.0:** Hide pom poms under tape, inside containers, or behind small barriers — toddlers love the challenge!

**Mini erasers:** Use pom poms to erase chalk or dry erase boards. You can even stick one on the end of a marker to promote in-hand manipulation and tripod grasp.

**Citrus squeezer play:** Place pom poms inside a handheld citrus squeezer and have your toddler squeeze to pick them up or drop them into a cup. This builds fine motor strength, bilateral coordination, and hand endurance in a playful way!

------

## Pom Poms for Bigger Kids

**Pencil helper:** Tuck a small pom pom under the ring and pinky fingers to encourage a proper tripod grasp while writing.

**Feed the tennis ball:** Cut a “mouth” in a tennis ball and have your child squeeze it open with one hand while feeding pom poms inside with the other. This builds bilateral coordination, fine motor strength, and motor planning.

**Creative fun:** Use pom poms for crafting, color matching, or art projects — all great ways to boost tactile, visual-motor, and fine motor skills while having fun.

------

Quick, colorful, and full of developmental magic — pom poms are proof that sometimes the simplest toys make the biggest impact!

You’ve fed them, you’ve burped them, you’ve changed them…now what?! Here are some ways to fill those small but mighty wake windows in the newborn phase that are beneficial to you and your little one.

1. **Infant massage** - Infant massage is such a sweet way to provide your baby with much needed tactile and proprioceptive input, as well as bond with your baby. Providing tactile input produces oxytocin for you and your baby, which promotes bonding and is a mood stabilizer. In addition, providing these types of sensory input help your baby develop body awareness. It also provides a calming effect and was very effective for us in the ‘witching hour.’ There is no right or wrong way to massage. I use our favorite lotion and start by gliding my hands gently over baby’s arms, then legs. Then I spend some time on those tiny toes and move the ankles through their full range of motion. This is especially helpful to work out any awkward positioning from their time in the womb. You can add in tummy massage to work through any gas or discomfort as well.
2. **Crossing midline activities** - Crossing the midline is so important right from the start! It gets both sides of the brain communicating and is important for developmental skills like visual tracking, rolling, reaching, etc. Later on, we use these skills to develop our overall bilateral coordination (using both sides of the body together) and reading. To do this, simply take both of your baby’s arms in your hands, and passively reach them one on top of the other, as if the baby is crossing their arms, and repeat. Do the same with the legs. Finally, reach the opposite hand to the opposite leg, and repeat on the other side. I do each of these ‘exercises’ 10 times, but there is really no right or wrong.
3. **Tummy time** - Tummy time may be one of the most important things to do in the early days. It is essential to develop core muscles needed to reach all major milestones like sitting, crawling, etc. It develops the strength needed to lift the head, which is essential for exploration and learning. Our babies are so scrunched up in the flexion position in utero, it is important to help them develop their extensor muscles outside the womb. It is best to sit baby up on his bottom first supporting his head, then lie him down, tuck his arm into his body, and roll him into tummy time. Make sure he gets time facing his head in each direction if he is not yet lifting it. Tummy time does count on your chest, but it also makes it easier for baby. Try putting them on the ground for tummy time at least once per day. At this age, just 5 minutes of tummy time in each wake window will go a long way!
4. **Get outside** - Getting outside is so beneficial to both you and your baby. The richest sensory experiences are formed outside. You can take your baby for a walk, or simply sit with them outside. Exposing them to safe sunlight helps them learn to orient day and night and will encourage some longer stretches of night sleep. Those early days are hard, it is so helpful for parents to get out of the house and experience the world as well.
5. **Dance** - It may seem silly, but dancing is a great way to give your little one vestibular input. Vestibular input is the type of sensory input that helps us understand our sense of movement. It serves as our ‘battery pack’ and helps us determine when we should ‘rev up’ to do more, or slow down to do less. As your baby gets older, it will be integral in their ability to regulate their arousal level. Baby’s brain is making so many connections at this age and it is best to start sensory integration right away. Furthermore, baby was getting so much vestibular input in the womb, it's important to continue on earth side. Dancing is also a natural mood booster for parents. Remember, movement is medicine and all of our sensory systems need a boost!

'Tis the season to whip up something tasty for your Valentine! And in between baking, why not involve your kiddos with your trusty baking sheet?

## Baking Sheets for Babies

Transform a rimmed baking sheet into a sensory station for babies! Fill it with a small amount of water and add light toys like balls or bath toys for splashy tummy time fun. Alternatively, use shaving cream, whipped cream, or sand for a messy sensory experience. Don't forget to include baby's feet in the sensory play for added engagement!

## Baking Sheets for Toddlers

Baking sheets make an excellent canvas for playing with magnets, promoting fine motor coordination and visual motor skills. Use letter magnets to encourage language and literacy development. Additionally, baking sheets are perfect for containing toys and activities with small or messy pieces. Playing with playdough on a baking sheet keeps everything contained and your floor (somewhat) clean!

## Baking Sheets for Bigger Kids

Challenge your older kids with baking sheet activities that promote strength and coordination. Can they carry the baking sheet with objects like a block tower without toppling it over? This activity enhances impulse control, body awareness, and motor planning. Experiment with heavier objects like canned goods to further promote grip, upper extremity strength, and core engagement. Engage in pretend play by setting up a restaurant scenario where your child uses the baking sheet to deliver food, a win-win for both of you!

Get your kiddos involved in the kitchen action and watch their sensory motor skills flourish with this simple kitchen staple!

_For 0-3 months [click here](wake-windows-0-3-months)_

The 3-6 month phase was one of my favorites!  You are finally getting some positive feedback and encouragement from your little one– the smiles, the coos, watching them make connections and learn, it is truly the best!  Here are some ways to facilitate 3-6 month development!

1. **Rotisserie chicken play!** - The best place for your baby while they are awake is on the floor.  While Tummy Time gets a lot of the spotlight, it is also important to try side lying and back lying positions.  Treat that baby like a rotisserie chicken and allow them to have time on all sides.  At this age, babies should be able to track objects across midline and will start reaching for objects.  To encourage this, present toys that make noise, light up, and are novel, even kitchen spoons work!  We are continuing to look for symmetry in different positions, pay attention to your baby’s limb movements and encourage movements on both sides.
2. **Tummy time** - Tummy time is still beneficial and important at this stage!  Now, your baby should be lifting their head, tracking objects, and reaching.  Prop up a book to keep it interesting and present toys that they can reach for, listen to, etc.  Tummy time mats are great to use to keep things novel.  You can also introduce tummy time over a yoga ball to facilitate more movement and head control.
3. **Facilitating rolling** - One of the big important milestones in this range is rolling.  Be sure to roll your baby in and out of tummy time to encourage the motor plan.  You can also passively roll the baby side to side holding their hands and feet together. 
4. **Get outside** - Outside time is still beneficial for you and for the baby!  You cannot beat the sensory experiences from outside.  You can take a walk, or set up a blanket with some toys.  This is especially beneficial in the witching hour (that difficult period in the evening before bedtime).
5. **Reach the feet!** - Encouraging your baby to reach for their feet is an important mini-milestone that will help them learn to roll.   It is essential for both sensory development and core strengthening, and can be done in a supine, side lying, or reclined position such as in a stroller.  To facilitate, place [sock rattles](https://www.amazon.com/Infant-Rattle-Socks-Months-Learning/dp/B09GLH9SCQ/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3LIPDY48KROYH&keywords=sock+rattles&qid=1688749096&sprefix=sock+rattles%2Caps%2C118&sr=8-5){:target="_blank"} on the baby’s feet, drape party beads over their feet, or simply place their hands on their feet. 
6. **Tracking** - Babies are starting to see more and more at this stage and are little sponges, constantly learning about new things in their environment!  It is a great time to start and continue working on visual tracking.  To facilitate tracking, hold a book, rattle, preferred toy, etc. about 6-12 inches away from their face.  Starting at one side of the head, get the baby’s attention until they are looking at the object.  Slowly move the object across their face allowing them to turn their head in response to the movement.  If they do not follow right away or all the way across midline, try again and use more verbal cues. Visual tracking can help babies learn about depth perception, increase neck range of motion, and address oculomotor skills necessary for future readers!  In addition, crossing the midline is always great for brain development!  Babies should be able to turn their heads from the point where their chins are at their shoulders across to the other shoulder.  If your baby cannot get their chin at least between their nipple line and shoulder, it may be a good idea to reach out to a pediatric OT or PT who can help with range of motion and look out for signs of torticollis.
7. **Splashing!** - Splashing is a great activity for developing sensory systems!  Babies at this age can splash with their hands in water on a tray during tummy time (provided they can hold their heads up for extended periods), or splash while sitting in front of a bucket of water, tray of water, or at the sink.  This is a great way for babies to learn body awareness and gain more control over their hands.  Placing their feet in water is also great for increasing awareness of the lower extremity to promote core strength and rolling.
8. **Magic baby** - Babies love movement!  At this time, they likely have some more head control and can be faced outward to see the world.  Magic baby is a great trick that can help a fussy baby regulate, and provide some vestibular input to further improve movement and body awareness.  To facilitate, hold baby against your chest facing outward (hint: lots of babies love this in front of a mirror).  Then, move the baby up and down by doing squats, or around in a circular motion.  If your baby was prescribed any head/neck stretches, this is a great way to get it done!

Foil is something we all have lying around.  In addition to a must have in the kitchen, it can be a must have to spice up play time!  

Foil is best used for babies 6 months and up who are able to control their hands.  It is shiny, malleable, and makes an interesting, satisfying noise for babies!

- Wrap your baby’s favorite toys in foil, and demonstrate opening it.  This promotes bilateral coordination (using both hands together), fine motor coordination, visual motor integration skills, problem solving, and tactile processing skills.  For younger babies, try folding the foil loosely, and as your baby gets older and more skilled, you can wrap toys more tightly.
- Use foil as a backdrop for a finger painting.  The foil will be smooth in places, and textured in others providing increased feedback to improve awareness and fine motor skills.  Try taping the foil to a vertical surface to promote wrist extension and shoulder stability.  This is a great way to provide a multi-sensory approach to teach pre-writing strokes (circles, lines, intersecting lines, diagonal lines) and writing letters and numbers.
- Tear foil into pieces to add to a sensory bin.  Tearing paper and foil requires pincer grasp development, MP flexion (bent thumb posture), and bilateral coordination.  It is a great way to develop hand division and strength necessary for appropriate grasp patterns.
- Crumble foil into balls and throw them into a container.  This works on fine motor strengthening, bilateral coordination, and upper limb coordination.   It is also a great way to integrate grasping reflexes.
- Write “messages” draw pictures, letters, shapes, etc. on foil, then crumble it up.  Have your child open the foil and look at the message.  For older kiddos, you can have them copy the form you made inside.  This is great for fine motor coordination, bilateral coordination, visual motor integration, and grasping reflex integration.

Foil can be fun for all ages, and not just in the kitchen!  It is packed with fine motor benefits for the whole family.

It seems like many of the children in my life are getting ear tubes. While getting ear tubes placed is a routine and common procedure for pediatricians and ENTs, there are important sensory implications that parents should be aware of.

## What Causes Frequent Ear Infections in Children?

Ear infections can be caused by a myriad of issues. One of the reasons children get more ear infections than adults is that their Eustachian tubes, or the tube that connects the middle ear to the nose and throat are smaller, narrower, and more horizontally oriented than adults. This, along with the exposure to more germs and immature immune systems, make it easier for fluid and bacteria to build up in the middle ear.

## What Are Ear Tubes, and Why Does My Child Need Them?

Ear tubes are designed to prevent recurring ear infections. If a child experiences more than 4–6 ear infections in a year or has an ear infection that doesn’t improve after multiple rounds of antibiotics, ear tubes are often recommended. These small tubes are placed in the eardrum to help drain fluid from the middle ear and allow air to flow in and out, preventing further fluid buildup. Ear tubes also help equalize pressure in the inner ear.

## How Frequent Ear Infections Affect the Vestibular System

The **vestibular system** is a key sensory system that detects motion and changes in head position, playing a vital role in balance, muscle tone, motor development, and sensory regulation. This system consists of the peripheral system within the inner ear and the central nervous system, where the brain and spinal cord process input from the inner ear’s receptors.

The peripheral system includes three semicircular canals that detect rotational movement (think of shaking your head) and otolith organs that sense linear motion (like walking or bouncing). These structures contain tiny hair cells that shift in response to movement, triggering nerve signals that are sent to the brain.

When a child experiences an ear infection, these hair cells may be dampened, preventing them from moving freely. This can lead to difficulties with balance, coordination, and overall vestibular processing. Additionally, the child may experience muffled sounds, which can impact language development.

## What Can I Do to Support My Child?

If your child has had frequent ear infections, it’s important to ensure they’re receiving enough **vestibular input** to help their nervous system process and respond to sensory information. Activities that provide vestibular input include:

* Swinging
* Sliding
* Bouncing
* Dancing
* Rocking
* Head inversions

## What Should I Be Aware of After Ear Tube Placement?

After ear tube placement, your child may be able to hear more clearly, but they could also become fearful of loud or unexpected sounds. Be mindful of this if you’re in loud or crowded areas. You can help ease their fear by labeling sounds and involving them in controlling the noise. For instance, if the sound of running bathwater overwhelms them, let your child help turn the faucet on and off to control the sound.

Your child might also become more tolerant of vestibular input after the procedure—or they could feel overwhelmed by it. Signs of overwhelm include dysregulation, fear of heights, or avoidance of movement. In these cases, offering deep pressure tactile and proprioceptive feedback can help. This could include activities such as:

* Giving a bear hug
* Engaging in heavy work (e.g., pushing or pulling heavy objects)
* Playing with playdough or putty

When introducing vestibular input, start with linear, predictable movements and avoid spinning or head inversions. If your child seeks more movement, allow them to engage in these activities, but watch for signs of overwhelm, such as dilated pupils, flushed skin, or sweating. You can help regulate their response by “sandwiching” vestibular activities with activities like jumping, squeezing, or placing gentle pressure on their head, or encouraging them to suck on a water bottle or hard candy.

## Therapy Considerations

Occupational therapists (OTs) should be aware of recurring ear infections, as these can affect a child’s balance and motor development. If a child is delayed in crawling or walking, ear infections or ear tube placement may be a contributing factor. Since ear tubes eventually fall out, it’s important for providers to be aware of their placement and whether they’ve come out to monitor any changes or challenges in the vestibular system.

Speech therapists should also consider any potential changes in auditory processing skills when working with children who have had frequent ear infections or ear tube placement.

## Conclusion

Being prepared for ear tube placement can help you and your child navigate the process more smoothly. If you have ongoing concerns about your child’s motor development or sensory processing skills, consider reaching out for an occupational therapy evaluation to ensure their needs are fully addressed.

Babies by nature reach and grab everything they see (goodbye wearing your hair down). Instead of allowing your baby to pull out all of your luscious locks, try painters tape instead.

### Set up

Painters tape can be used on a variety of surfaces like a wall, tray, or even on a binder to provide a slanted surface. Tear a piece of tape about 5 inches long and tape it to your surface in horizontal or vertical lines leaving the bottom or side inch loose. Position your baby in front of the tape and demonstrate pulling the tape off the wall or whatever surface you use.

### Benefits of using painters tape

- Developing a pincer grasp - using the thumb and index fingers will strengthen baby’s hands so that they can do more functional things like hold utensils and writing materials later on. Developing a pincer grasp is also essential in self feeding
- Crossing midline - placing the tape horizontally will encourage your baby to reach across the midline of their body, which is an essential skill necessary for bilateral coordination, eventually reading, and in short activating both sides of the brain
- Seated posture - sitting your baby in front of a vertical surface and allowing them to reach up to the tape will improve core strength and seated posture necessary for feeding readiness. Reaching overhead is also essential to develop upper extremity muscles
- Using a slanted surface (such as a binder) and placing it in front of baby in tummy time will encourage them to stay in tummy time longer, and lift their head against gravity
- Visual motor skill development - Babies must see the tape, then form a motor plan to get to it, thus improving visual motor integration skills. These foundational skills are essential for handwriting and drawing later on.

Enjoy this simple and fun activity with your little one! It can be repeated over and over again and never gets old!

Motor skills are at the forefront of development and affect all areas of daily function. However, it is sometimes unclear what constitutes a gross motor skill and what constitutes a fine motor skill, and how you know if your child is on track for both.

Gross motor skills are movements that involve larger muscle groups, such as walking, running and jumping. Fine motor skills are more refined movements of the hands, fingers and toes such as picking up a toy and placing it into a container. Gross motor development affects fine motor development. Proximal stability results in distal mobility, meaning babies and children must develop gross motor skills such as postural control prior to developing fine motor skills such as reaching and grasping.

Let’s look at development from the newborn phase on, and what the key milestones to look for are for each age group.

## Key Milestones by Age

### 0-6 Months
* **Fine Motor Skills:** Babies should be able to reach for and grasp objects by 6 months of age.
* **Gross Motor Skills:** Babies should be able to roll from back to belly and belly to back, and sit unsupported for several seconds by 6 months.

### 6-12 months
* **Fine Motor Skills:** Babies should be able to pick up objects, bang two objects together, switch objects between hands, and a pincer grasp should emerge.
* **Gross motor skills:** Babies should be able to sit unsupported, crawl in a reciprocal pattern on their hands and knees, pull to stand and cruise on furniture. Some babies may begin taking steps.

### 12-18 Months
* **Fine Motor Skills:** Babies/toddlers should be able to use a neat pincer grasp, stack 2-3 blocks, scribble with markers, and use utensils (with assistance and some spills).
* **Gross Motor Skills:** Babies will should begin walking independently, kicking a ball, and safely navigating stairs (scooting down stairs and maneuvering furniture).

### 18-24 Months
* **Fine Motor Skills:** Toddlers should begin stacking blocks, using toys such as a shape sorter, and refine use of utensils. They should be able to hold an object in one hand and use the other hand to manipulate it.
* **Gross Motor Skills:** Toddlers should be able to run and jump with both feet.

### 2 Years
* **Fine Motor Skills:** 2-year-olds should be able to place simple puzzle pieces, start managing zippers (pull up initiated zipped jackets), refine stacking skills and place small objects into a container. By 2.5 years, toddlers should be able to use a fork and a spoon with proficiency.
* **Gross Motor Skills:** 2-year-olds should be able to run and jump more confidently, navigate stairs safely (in a step-to pattern), and throw a ball overhand.

### 3 years
* **Fine Motor Skills:** 3-year-olds should start imitating pre-writing strokes such as circles, +, horizontal and vertical lines. They should be able to snip with scissors, and should have the bilateral coordination skills required to don and doff elastic waist pants independently.
* **Gross Motor Skills:** 3-Year-olds should be able to balance on one foot, navigate stairs in a reciprocal pattern, begin riding a tricycle.

### 4 years
* **Fine Motor Skills:** 4-year-olds should be able to imitate shapes, cut out simple shapes with scissors (square, circle), draw a person with 2-4 body parts.
* **Gross Motor Skills:** 4-year-olds should be able to climb, skip, and hop on one foot.

### 5 years
* **Fine Motor Skills:** 5-year-olds should be able to imitate most letters, use scissors to cut more complex shapes, and manage fasteners on clothing.
* **Gross motor skills:** 5-year-olds should be able to start riding a bike without training wheels.

### 6 years
* **Fine motor skills:** 6-year-olds should demonstrate improved handwriting skills and tripod/quadrupod grasp patterns, tie shoelaces, manage fasteners (including those on back).
* **Gross motor skills:** 6-year-olds should be able to engage in organized sports and activities.

## How to Know if Your Child Needs Intervention

Your child may surprise you! If you are not sure if they can do any of the above tasks within their age range, encourage them to try! A lot of times children just haven’t been exposed to the tools they need to be able to complete a task. For example, several 3-year-olds have never used scissors, and that is okay! If you notice that your child may be behind in several areas, it is a good idea to raise concerns with your child’s teacher and pediatrician. Scheduling an occupational therapy evaluation may also be necessary. An occupational therapist will be able to evaluate your child to determine if they have the underlying skills necessary to complete the tasks listed above. OT’s are trained in activity analysis and will be able to determine the factors that contribute to deficits and how to facilitate development. OT’s will be able to provide targeted intervention to help your child, and provide suggestions for how to work on these skills at home through play based tasks and activities.

Both fine and gross motor skills are foundational for overall development and facilitating independence throughout childhood. They are often linked and one may affect the other. Occupational therapists can help determine if a child is on track for development, and if they are not, what underlying skills need further development to facilitate motor skills.

I seem to always find hair ties lying around.  Luckily, they can be for more than just holding your hair back from a baby who loves to pull!  Hair ties and scrunchies can be used for a variety of play activities and can be very beneficial!

## Babies

- Place scrunchies or hair ties over babies feet to facilitate reaching for their feet!  This is great for core strengthening, body awareness, and rolling readiness for babies 3 months +  they are a cheaper alternative to booties 
- Place a scrunchie over your baby’s wrist and encourage them to reach across midline to pull it off of their opposite arm.  This will address hand strengthening and crossing midline

## Toddlers
- Scrunchies are an excellent tool for practicing donning socks!  Have your child sit on the floor and pull the scrunchies over their feet to facilitate the skill.  This also acts as a bonus for core strengthening!
- Pick a favorite stuffed animal to pull scrunchies over.  This is great for fine motor coordination, bilateral coordination (using both hands together) and problem solving
- Scrunchies can be a great tool for sorting!  Have your child place similar colors together into containers.  This addresses visual perceptual skills, executive functioning skills, and fine motor skills required to manipulate containers

## Bigger Kids
Scrunchies and hair ties make great slingshots!  Creating a slingshot and manipulating slingshots are great for building fine motor strength and bilateral coordination

Happy mardi gras season! If you are looking for something to do with all of those left over beads, look no further!

Mardi gras (or party beads) are a great tool for any age. They are shiny, interesting, and make fun sounds and can be used in a variety of beneficial ways.

- Place them over your young baby’s feet as they lie on their back to encourage reaching. This will promote core strength as your little one attempts to pull his feet towards his body. It also promotes a ‘mini milestone’ bringing feet to the mouth, which helps with body awareness, sensory integration, and provides a precursor to dressing milestones like taking on and off socks.
- Use them as a way to motivate during tummy time. Place a few beads in front of your baby and shake them. The sound and visual input will encourage your baby to explore what is in front of them and encourage them to lift their heads. It also provides a great distraction from the hard work they are doing.
- Using a hard surface such as the floor or a cookie sheet, place the beads gently down and make a sound. This can help introduce cause and effect, an essential skill for cognition.
- Lots of beads in a tub make a great sensory bin. Hide some smaller toys in them and have your baby reach and pull them out. This will encourage tactile processing and tactile discrimination skills. In addition, lifting strands of beads will promote development of a pincer grasp. Best of all, the clean up is so easy! No need to pick up single grains of rice or beans.
- Party beads are great for helping your toddler learn to put on a shirt overhead or step into pants and pull them up. Simply model putting the beads overhead or stepping into them, and have your child repeat. This encourages body awareness and uses motor learning to encourage independence in dressing skills.

Enjoy this activity through the many stages of childhood! As parents, we can have fun and let our kids benefit from the party. I do recommend only playing with beads under adult supervision.

It’s summer BBQ season! Before you use up all your chip clips sealing bags of snacks, set a few aside for playtime—because these simple tools offer *amazing fine motor benefits*!

## Babies
Stick magnetic chip clips on the fridge to hold lightweight toys or fabric strips. This encourages babies to sit upright while reaching, building **core strength, postural control, and upper body engagement** — all through play!

## Young Kids
Turn your chip clips into pretend tongs! Have your child use them to pick up pom poms and sort them by color in a muffin tin. This builds **fine motor strength, coordination, and the open-close motion needed for scissor skills**.

You can also swap traditional game pieces for chip clips! Use them to pick up or move pieces in board games — it’s a great way to sneak in some extra hand strengthening.

Try attaching movement cards or visuals to a climbing rope or wall using a chip clip. This makes active play even more exciting — and adds a little surprise to each movement!

Working on **independence with dressing or hygiene tasks**? Clip a chip clip to your child’s waistband or shorts and challenge them to reach for it—great for practicing shoulder mobility and body awareness in a playful way.

## Big Kids
For older kids, chip clips can add extra challenge to familiar activities.

- Build a cup pyramid using chip clips instead of hands.
- Sort small objects using the clip upside down for extra resistance.
- Time the activity to add a fun competitive twist!

Enjoy these chip clip suggestions, and maybe some yummy summer snacks while you are at it!

For some reason, everyone I know has sent my baby a blanket of some kind. My mom crochet a beautiful blanket, my mother in law hand stitched an amazing quilt, and others have sent every blanket under the sun from muslin blankets to fleece. Luckily, they can be used for more than just decor or tucked away in a drawer.

Enter blanket rides! The set up is super easy and involves simply lying your blanket out on the ground and lying your baby on top of it. You can burrito your baby up or let them lie right on the blanket depending on their sensory preference. Make sure your baby’s head is well supported on top of the blanket. Then, grab the end of the blanket and pull your baby around the room or hallway. While this activity seems so simple, there are several benefits for you and your little one.

- Wrapping in a blanket provides tactile input. Tactile input allows us to release oxytocin and helps with regulation. You can even intensify the input by giving a few gentle squeezes to your baby
- Pulling the baby provides vestibular input, or movement input that helps us understand our body’s position against gravity and assists with improving arousal levels
- The input of the baby's body against the ground provides additional tactile input and helps aid in understanding of body awareness
- Once your baby is able to sit up, pulling slowly while they are seated is an amazing way to develop core strength
- Laughing with and smiling with your baby promotes bonding and releases oxytocin and dopamine, which are mood enhancers and stabilizers that all moms need
- While your baby is light, pulling them provides proprioceptive input for mom, which can be regulating and give you a much needed boost of energy– movement is medicine after all
- Bonus: photos and videos of your baby enjoying a gifted blanket make for a very easy and heartfelt thank you note

When I was pregnant, people would often remark on how lucky I was that I already knew so much about child development and what to do with a baby, and they are right, I am lucky to have the knowledge that I have; however, I was holding myself to an impossible standard. I let go of a few things that markedly improved my well-being and increased my confidence in my new role.

1. **Getting off the apps** - There is truly an app for everything with babies. In the beginning, we would track everything from the time spent breastfeeding on each side, diaper changes, and sleep. We would use wonder weeks to justify our crying newborn. I have a master’s degree and extensive knowledge in child development, but I was still tracking milestones on an app, not to mention the number of TikTok reels I watched to justify my choices. After a while, we became less attached to tracking everything. In the beginning, we may have needed it to create some narrative of control, but in the end it was a distraction. Getting off the apps allowed me to be more attuned to my baby and more present.
2. **Taking “Me” time** - Prior to having my baby, my morning routine was everything. It included working out, walking the dog, and having a sit down breakfast with my husband every day. Obviously I don’t have time for that now, but it was so important for my mental health to find a way to fit some of these things in. Once I prioritized working out and getting out for a walk (now separately), I felt so much better. Initially, I felt some mom guilt over attending to myself instead of giving my baby undivided attention. I thought I would be able to do everything during naps, but my baby simply did not nap unless she was strapped to my chest. I allowed myself to do baby wearing workouts and eventually did them while my baby was working out herself in tummy time. It is okay to put your baby down and do something for yourself.
3. **Asking for help and prioritizing house work** - I have always had a hard time asking for help and I am still working on it. When I had my newborn I tried to do it all. Once I started asking myself “am I the only one who can do this?” I was able to prioritize and feel at ease. For example, I spent a ton of time pumping, no one else could do that, but my husband was able to wash my pumps or tend to the dishes in the sink.
4. **Ditching Moms on Call** - I hate to call out Moms on Call because I have friends and family who swear by it. There is nothing wrong with following a pre-set schedule if it works for you; however, I killed myself trying to make it work for us. Like I said earlier, my baby did not nap, it was simply not possible to follow an exact schedule when I was pacing around my house at a very specific cadence for 40+ minutes attempting to lull my baby to sleep. Once I accepted that it wasn’t working for us, I was able to follow my baby’s cues and follow a routine vs a set schedule. This is challenging because the world works around making plans at specific times, but it also helped me be flexible with scheduling and understand that we would all be okay if we had to leave the house during nap time.
5. **Understanding this is a season, not forever** - Wondering if you will ever sleep again, wondering if you baby will ever learn to like the solids you are serving, wondering if they will ever hit the next milestone is all part of being a new mom. Letting yourself believe that nothing is forever is super helpful, and will maybe even help you appreciate the season you are in. Hindsight is 20/20 of course, but I am hoping that the next time I am a new mom I will be able to treasure the newborn snuggles and stages and understand that we will all make it through this sweet little segment of life, and will definitely miss it one day.

Have you ever tried to bring in all of your groceries at once, just to save another trip to the car? This requires significant motor planning. Motor planning, also known as praxis, is the ability to perform a new or skilled motor task, and is dependent upon adequate body awareness, tactile processing, ideation, initiation, timing, sequencing, feedback and feedforward. It is how quickly we learn a motor skill and the ability to generalize it to other situations. A weakness with motor planning impacts the ability to think of what to do. For example, a child who has difficulty with motor planning may have difficulty carrying out multi step tasks such as getting themselves ready for school.

Motor planning is a learned skill. Babies are not born knowing how to move from place to place; however, given the opportunity to independently move, they learn how to lift their heads against gravity, roll over, sit, pull to stand, and walk. As a baby’s sensory system develops, they become more aware of their body and how it interacts with the world around them, allowing them to move effectively.

Here are some suggestions for how to improve each of the parts of motor planning.

## Body Awareness

Body awareness is the knowledge of body parts, and the awareness of how the body moves in relation to the muscles and joints. It is essential in learning how your body moves in space. Body awareness requires proprioceptive processing. Proprioception is the sense that determines a limb’s position in space through receptors in the muscles and joints. Some ways to improve body awareness are to:

* Play games and with toys that require an understanding of body parts. Build Mr. Potato head, play “head shoulders knees and toes” and practice drawing a person with body parts.
* Improve proprioception through “heavy work” or activities that require pushing and pulling such as pulling toys in a wagon, helping with household chores such as sweeping, and doing simple animal walk exercises.

## Tactile Processing

Tactile processing is the way the body responds to feedback from the outermost system of our body, our skin. It is the way we process touch and respond to it. A healthy tactile system helps us respond to the environment safely. For example, it helps us determine if an object is too hot or too cold to touch. Children who have difficulty with tactile processing may be hypersensitive to tactile input, and become bothered by “safe” textures such as different types of clothing. They may also be hyposensitive to tactile input and touch everything in an attempt to process information they may be missing. Some ways to improve tactile processing are:

* Play with sensory bins (beans, rice, sand, pasta, etc).
* Do arts and crafts with “messy” substances such as paints, glue or even whipped cream.
* Play with play doh, putty, or slime.

## Ideation

Ideation is the ability to form ideas or concepts. In motor planning, the ability to visualize the steps that should be taken to complete a task and how to move the body to do so. Children who have difficulty with ideation may imitate other children rather than initiating tasks on their own, have difficulty carrying out multi step tasks, don’t make suggestions for what to play, or have difficulty with free play. Some ways to promote ideation are:

* Engage in constructive play activities such as building with legos, making something with play doh, building with squigz, etc.
* Practice visualization with familiar places, for example, have a child describe their bedroom.
* Make an obstacle course, you can grade this activity by creating the first few steps, then have the child add the last step and increase the number of steps until they are independent. Using leading language such as “after you step off of the pillow, where will your feet be” can be helpful in ideation.

## Initiation

Initiation is the skill required to begin an activity. It requires executive functioning skills and the ability to plan and organize tasks. In motor planning, the child may be able to visualize a task, but has difficulty understanding how to move their body in the specific way required. Some ways to promote initiation are:

* Play games with clear starting points such as Simon Says, Red Light Green Light, Follow the Leader.
* Go on a scavenger hunt with a list of items to find. This can be done in the house or on a nature walk.
* Picture schedules, or simple drawings of steps can also be helpful for those who have trouble initiating.

## Timing

Timing is the speed with which we perform actions. It is how we process where we are in response the environment. For example, when the timing of the brain does not match the tempo of the environment, we can become out of sync. Think about jumping rope, timing is everything to jump at the right time so that we can get over the rope. When we don’t have an idea of timing, this is extremely difficult. Ways to improve timing are:

* Use verbal and visual cues during motor tasks such as clapping to the beat of a song.
* Dribbling a ball on beat.
* Hop, skip or jump following a verbal cue (jump when I say “go).

## Feedback and Feedforward

Feedback occurs during a motor action and is used to execute a motor sequence using ongoing monitoring of movement. It allows us to make necessary adjustments to movement. Feedforward uses information from the environment prior to the movement. Feedforward occurs prior to completing a motor action and uses previously learned motor actions to allow us to execute new actions. When there are difficulties with feedback and feedforward, a child may be able to complete one single motor task such as a jumping jack but will have difficulty completing a cycle of 10 jumping jacks as they have difficulty adjusting during the movement. Some ways to improve feedback and feedforward are:

* Completing motor sequences in a mirror so that the child can see what the motor action looks like
* Repeat, repeat, repeat! Use motor learning theory to continue tasks to improve our brain’s response to the task.
* Use increased cueing (visual verbal and manual cues) to improve a motor sequence.

Motor planning affects everything we do from brushing our teeth to completing an exercise routine. Breaking motor planning down to its parts may be beneficial in helping those with motor planning deficits achieve improved performance.

I love pipe cleaners! 🙌 They’re affordable, colorful, and so versatile—perfect for easy, last-minute play across all age groups. Whether you’ve got a baby or a big kid, these activities are quick to set up and fun to play.

### For Babies 👶

#### 1. Pipe Cleaner Sensory Bin
Pop some pipe cleaners into a plastic container and let your baby explore! Their soft-yet-scratchy texture provides a safe, mess-free sensory experience that keeps your baby’s tactile system learning and growing.

#### 2. Pipe Cleaner + Colander Pull
Thread pipe cleaners through the holes of a colander and encourage your baby to pull them out.
**Supports:** pincer grasp, visual motor skills, upper extremity strength, cause and effect

### For Toddlers (1.5–3 Years) 🧸

#### 3. Toy Rescue Mission
Wrap a favorite toy in pipe cleaners and invite your toddler to “rescue” it.
**Encourages:** fine motor strength, bilateral coordination, and early problem-solving

#### 4. Shape Builders
Use pipe cleaners to form basic shapes like triangles, squares, or circles. Let your toddler count the sides and feel the corners as they play.
**Great for:** pre-writing development and visual motor skills through a multi-sensory approach

#### 5. Bead Stringing Made Easy
Pipe cleaners are stiffer than string, making them a great starting point for bead threading. Use pony beads, cereal, or cut-up straws!
**Develops:** bilateral coordination, fine motor control, and hand-eye coordination

### For Bigger Kids (4+ Years) 🧠

#### 6. Shoe Tying Practice
Learning to tie shoes? Start with pipe cleaners! Their structure makes them easier to manage than floppy shoelaces while still teaching the motor planning and sequence of tying.

#### 7. DIY Art & Sculptures
Encourage creative construction—make animals, flowers, glasses, or anything they dream up!
**Builds:** ideation, fine motor precision, spatial awareness, and perseverance

#### 8. Braiding, Threading, and Jewelry Making
Make friendship bracelets, thread pipe cleaners into a colorful bookmark, or a statement necklace!
**Builds:** bilateral coordination skills, fine motor coordination skills, visual spatial skills

If you’ve got some pipe cleaners lying around, you’ve got a full afternoon of developmental play ready to go. These quick ideas are perfect for busy days, indoor breaks, or when you need something engaging now.

Back-to-school season is officially over, but you might still be seeing some concerning changes in your child's behavior. Don't worry, you're not alone! Many parents report that their kids experience regressions—a temporary step back in skills they had already mastered—especially with things like toileting. It can be frustrating when everything was going so well, but it's a common and normal reaction to a major life change. Let's explore why this happens and what you can do to help.

## Understanding the "Why" Behind Regressions

Going back to school is a huge transition filled with new teachers, new schedules, and new demands. For many children, especially those with sensitive sensory systems, this can be incredibly overwhelming. Their little brains are working overtime to cope with this new environment. This can affect their ability to process internal signals, a skill called **interoception**.

Think of interoception as the body's internal GPS. It's how we know we're hungry, tired, or need to use the bathroom. When a child's sensory system is on overload, these internal signals can get mixed up or ignored, making it harder for them to recognize when they need to go.

A regression may also be a child's way of gaining a sense of control. At school, they have to follow specific rules and schedules. They are constantly being told what to do and when. Sometimes, the only thing they feel they have power over is their own body, including when (and if) to use the bathroom.

Finally, new environments are often a source of anxiety. A child who is used to a predictable routine at home might be afraid to ask for permission to use the restroom at school, especially if they are new to advocating for themselves.

## How to Help Your Child Through It

Here are some practical, gentle strategies you can use to support your child.

### If it's sensory-related...

Develop a sensory routine to help them manage overwhelm. Simple activities can make a big difference:

*   **Before school:** Have a quick dance party, do "animal walks" to the bathroom to brush teeth, or take a short walk outside.
*   **During the day (at home):** Teach your child simple, discreet ways to get sensory input, like "chair push-ups" (pushing their hands on the chair seat), squeezing their hands together, or a brief head shake.
*   **After school and before bed:** Continue with the sensory routine to help them unwind and regulate.

### To build interoception skills...

Help your child connect with their body's signals by talking about feelings and sensations. Narrate your own experiences: "I feel some pressure in my lower tummy, so I'm going to use the potty now." Talk about other feelings, too, like feeling happy after a morning hug or feeling tired after a long day. This helps them learn the language to describe their own internal sensations.

### To help with a need for control...

Dedicate just 10 minutes of uninterrupted, intentional time to your child each day. Let them choose the activity. This one-on-one time helps them feel seen and heard, which can boost emotional stability and reduce the need to control other areas of their life.

### Working with the school...

Talk to your child's teacher or school administrator. Find out what the bathroom break protocol is. Empower your child by letting them know you are working with the school to make them feel comfortable. In some cases, a little advocacy on your part might be necessary to ensure your child's needs are met.

## Remember to Stay Positive

Most importantly, avoid shaming your child. Meet them with encouragement and understanding. Pulling the plug on potty training or showing frustration can make the problem worse. Like most things in parenting, this is likely a short phase that will pass with a little patience and support. ❤️

Mrs. Maria is the exact type of person that you want your child to be with because her warmth coupled with her ability to make everything fun - while also learning - is a gift unlike anything I have ever seen! <b>I can not recommend Mrs. Maria enough!</b>"

    - text: "As a new mom, <b>I didn't know if my baby's was developing properly</b>...she hated tummy time and being touched. Mrs. Maria helped me understand what was going on with her sensory needs and gave me simple ways to support her at home. Now our daughter is so much more curious, and loves to play! Mrs. Maria's calm presence in our therapy sessions and advice afterwards brought real relief — <b>we're so grateful we found her when we did!</b>"

    - text: "<b>Mrs. Maria has been such a gift to our family!!</b> Our son really struggled with transitions and staying focused at school — every day felt like a challenge. Starting in the first session he LOVED Mrs. Maria, and she gave us tips and strategies that actually made a difference. We've seen real progress with him: mornings are smoother, and teachers are shocked about how much better he is in class. <b>Mrs. Maria has made a huge impact, and we're endlessly thankful for her support.</b>"

  # This is the detailed bio for the dedicated page
  subtext: |
    Maria is a pediatric occupational therapist who brings warmth, expertise, and deep compassion to the families she serves. She earned her Bachelor of Health Science from the University of Florida in 2014, followed by a Master of Science in Occupational Therapy from Florida Gulf Coast University in 2017. Since then, she has dedicated her career to helping children thrive through a strengths-based, individualized approach.

    Maria is passionate about supporting children's development by emphasizing sensory processing skills to promote emotional regulation, motor coordination, and learning readiness. She also incorporates reflex integration strategies to support foundational movement patterns and neurological development. Her approach is both evidence-informed and rooted in meaningful connection—with children and their families.

    Maria is also a part-time instructor in the Occupational Therapy program at Georgia State University, where she enjoys mentoring future therapists and sharing her knowledge with both students and families. Her teaching reflects her commitment to empowering others through practical, family-centered strategies.

    As a mother of two, Maria deeply understands the challenges and joys of parenting. She strives to offer realistic, sustainable support that fits within the natural flow of daily family life. She is just as passionate about encouraging and equipping parents as she is about working directly with children.

    Maria brings advanced training in sensory integration, reflex integration, eye movement disorders, feeding therapy, DIR/Floortime, Handwriting Without Tears, Astronaut Training, and the treatment of plagiocephaly without a helmet. Her extensive continuing education allows her to tailor therapy with care and precision.

    Above all, Maria is honored to be part of your child's journey. She looks forward to walking alongside your family with compassion, creativity, and clinical expertise.

# FAQ Content (Kept separate as requested)
faq:
  title: "Your Questions Answered"
  subtitle: "Find information about payments, insurance, appointments, and more."
  items:
    - question: "What is your payment process?"
      answer: |
        All payments are securely processed through our HIPAA-compliant payment processor, Jane Payments. When you schedule your child's initial evaluation, you will complete intake forms where you can safely enter your credit card, HSA, or FSA information to be kept on file. Your card will be charged at the time of service.

    - question: "What is your cancellation policy?"
      answer: |
        We understand that life happens, and sometimes plans change! However, because each appointment is reserved just for you, we kindly ask for advance notice if you need to cancel or reschedule. Cancellations made within 48 hours of your appointment will incur a 25% fee, and those made within 24 hours will be charged 50% of the session fee.
        This policy helps us ensure that we can continue providing dedicated care to all the families we serve. We truly appreciate your understanding and cooperation!

    - question: "Do you accept insurance?"
      answer: |
        Insurance & Payment Information
        At Playful Progressions, we are a private-pay practice and do not accept commercial insurance. However, many insurance plans offer reimbursement for services received from an out-of-network provider. We are happy to provide superbills, which you can submit to your insurance company for potential reimbursement.
        Our superbills include the commonly used treatment codes:
        Therapeutic Activity: 97530
        Occupational Therapy Initial Evaluation: 97165, 97166, 97167
        We recommend checking with your insurance provider to understand your out-of-network benefits and reimbursement options. If you have any questions, we're happy to help guide you through the process!

    - question: "Why choose private pay over in-network providers?"
      answer: |
        While using insurance can be a great option, it's important to keep in mind that coverage is often subject to deductibles and coinsurance. We're here to provide high-quality, individualized therapy to support your child's development without unnecessary delays.
        If you have any questions about how we can help, we'd love to chat!

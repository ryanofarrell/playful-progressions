You’ve fed them, you’ve burped them, you’ve changed them…now what?! Here are some ways to fill those small but mighty wake windows in the newborn phase that are beneficial to you and your little one.

1. **Infant massage** - Infant massage is such a sweet way to provide your baby with much needed tactile and proprioceptive input, as well as bond with your baby. Providing tactile input produces oxytocin for you and your baby, which promotes bonding and is a mood stabilizer. In addition, providing these types of sensory input help your baby develop body awareness. It also provides a calming effect and was very effective for us in the ‘witching hour.’ There is no right or wrong way to massage. I use our favorite lotion and start by gliding my hands gently over baby’s arms, then legs. Then I spend some time on those tiny toes and move the ankles through their full range of motion. This is especially helpful to work out any awkward positioning from their time in the womb. You can add in tummy massage to work through any gas or discomfort as well.
2. **Crossing midline activities** - Crossing the midline is so important right from the start! It gets both sides of the brain communicating and is important for developmental skills like visual tracking, rolling, reaching, etc. Later on, we use these skills to develop our overall bilateral coordination (using both sides of the body together) and reading. To do this, simply take both of your baby’s arms in your hands, and passively reach them one on top of the other, as if the baby is crossing their arms, and repeat. Do the same with the legs. Finally, reach the opposite hand to the opposite leg, and repeat on the other side. I do each of these ‘exercises’ 10 times, but there is really no right or wrong.
3. **Tummy time** - Tummy time may be one of the most important things to do in the early days. It is essential to develop core muscles needed to reach all major milestones like sitting, crawling, etc. It develops the strength needed to lift the head, which is essential for exploration and learning. Our babies are so scrunched up in the flexion position in utero, it is important to help them develop their extensor muscles outside the womb. It is best to sit baby up on his bottom first supporting his head, then lie him down, tuck his arm into his body, and roll him into tummy time. Make sure he gets time facing his head in each direction if he is not yet lifting it. Tummy time does count on your chest, but it also makes it easier for baby. Try putting them on the ground for tummy time at least once per day. At this age, just 5 minutes of tummy time in each wake window will go a long way!
4. **Get outside** - Getting outside is so beneficial to both you and your baby. The richest sensory experiences are formed outside. You can take your baby for a walk, or simply sit with them outside. Exposing them to safe sunlight helps them learn to orient day and night and will encourage some longer stretches of night sleep. Those early days are hard, it is so helpful for parents to get out of the house and experience the world as well.
5. **Dance** - It may seem silly, but dancing is a great way to give your little one vestibular input. Vestibular input is the type of sensory input that helps us understand our sense of movement. It serves as our ‘battery pack’ and helps us determine when we should ‘rev up’ to do more, or slow down to do less. As your baby gets older, it will be integral in their ability to regulate their arousal level. Baby’s brain is making so many connections at this age and it is best to start sensory integration right away. Furthermore, baby was getting so much vestibular input in the womb, it's important to continue on earth side. Dancing is also a natural mood booster for parents. Remember, movement is medicine and all of our sensory systems need a boost!

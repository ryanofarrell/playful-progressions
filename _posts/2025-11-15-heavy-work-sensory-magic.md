Picture this: It's 5 PM. Dinner needs to be made, the baby is fussing, and your toddler is literally bouncing off the couch cushions. You feel your own stress levels rising, and the evening is spiraling before it even begins.

We've all been there. But what if I told you there's a simple, free tool you can use right now to help calm the chaos? In the occupational therapy world, we call it **Heavy Work**.

## What is Heavy Work?

It sounds like chores (and it certainly can be!), but scientifically, heavy work is any activity that provides **proprioceptive input**.

Proprioception is often called our "sixth sense". It tells our brain where our body is in space through receptors in our muscles and joints. When we push, pull, lift, carry, or squeeze, we activate these receptors. It’s the sensation you get when you stretch a resistance band or jump on a trampoline.

## Why Does It Work?

Think about how you feel after a long, tight hug, or maybe after a good workout or a heavy weighted blanket. You feel grounded, right? That is proprioception at work.

Heavy work is generally calming and organizing for the nervous system. It acts as a regulator. If a child is lethargic and slow-moving, heavy work can wake up their muscles. If a child is wild, uncoordinated, and seeking sensory input (crashing into walls, jumping on furniture), heavy work provides that input in a safe, organized way. It helps them feel "just right".

## Easy Heavy Work Ideas

You don't need fancy sensory gym equipment to get these benefits. Here are some of my favorite ways to sneak heavy work into our daily routine:

*   **The Laundry Express:** Have your child push a full laundry basket down the hall. It’s an amazing resistance exercise! We have a whole [Five Minute Friday post about this](/blog/five-minute-friday-laundry-baskets.html).
*   **Blanket Burritos or Rides:** Wrap them up tight in a blanket like a burrito (deep pressure is very calming!) or pull them around the floor on a blanket. Check out our [tips on blanket rides](/blog/five-minute-friday-blanket-rides.html) for more ideas.
*   **Animal Walks:** Have a "bear walk" (hands and feet on the floor) or "crab walk" race to the bathroom for bath time.
*   **Grocery Helper:** Let them carry the heavy milk jug or a bag of apples into the house. The weight provides excellent feedback to their joints.
*   **"Helping" Move Furniture:** Ask them to help you push the couch or a heavy chair to vacuum under it. Even if they aren't actually moving it much, the *effort* of pushing against a solid object provides intense proprioceptive input.
*   **Drinking Thick Liquids:** Sucking requires a lot of muscle work from the mouth and jaw, which is very organizing. A thick smoothie through a straw is a tasty form of heavy work!

## An OT-Mom Tip

Try to use heavy work *before* you think you need it. If you know transition times (like leaving the park, coming home from school, or getting ready for bed) are usually tricky, do 5 minutes of heavy work beforehand. It regulates their system and acts as a buffer, preparing them for what's next.

Give it a try next time the energy in your house feels a bit chaotic. You might be surprised at how much a little "heavy lifting" can help everyone feel more grounded. ❤️

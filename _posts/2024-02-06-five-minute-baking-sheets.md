## Baking Sheets for Babies

Transform a rimmed baking sheet into a sensory station for babies! Fill it with a small amount of water and add light toys like balls or bath toys for splashy tummy time fun. Alternatively, use shaving cream, whipped cream, or sand for a messy sensory experience. Don't forget to include baby's feet in the sensory play for added engagement!

## Baking Sheets for Toddlers

Baking sheets make an excellent canvas for playing with magnets, promoting fine motor coordination and visual motor skills. Use letter magnets to encourage language and literacy development. Additionally, baking sheets are perfect for containing toys and activities with small or messy pieces. Playing with playdough on a baking sheet keeps everything contained and your floor (somewhat) clean!

## Baking Sheets for Bigger Kids

Challenge your older kids with baking sheet activities that promote strength and coordination. Can they carry the baking sheet with objects like a block tower without toppling it over? This activity enhances impulse control, body awareness, and motor planning. Experiment with heavier objects like canned goods to further promote grip, upper extremity strength, and core engagement. Engage in pretend play by setting up a restaurant scenario where your child uses the baking sheet to deliver food, a win-win for both of you!

Get your kiddos involved in the kitchen action and watch their sensory motor skills flourish with this simple kitchen staple!

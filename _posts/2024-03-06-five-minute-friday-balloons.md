## Balloons for Babies

Attach a latex or helium balloon string to your baby's feet while they lie on their back. They'll love looking at the balloon and kicking their legs in excitement! This activity promotes core strength and prepares muscles for milestones like rolling. Plus, it enhances visual tracking, cognition (cause and effect), and attention.

## Balloons for Toddlers

Toddlers adore balloons! Balloons are excellent for motor development at this age. Have your toddler keep the balloon up in the air using their hands to enhance gross motor coordination, visual motor integration, and visual tracking. They can also kick balloons to work on balance, core strength, and gross motor skills.

## Balloons for Big Kids

Balloons can be fantastic for regulation in older children. Blowing up a balloon encourages deep breaths and utilizes oral motor skills for emotional and sensory regulation. Experiment with various props like fly swatters for a fun game of "keep the balloon up" or sit on yoga balls to promote core strength. Challenge your kids by using partially inflated balloons to move small objects like ping pong balls or cotton balls to a finish line. Incorporating challenging positions such as keeping a balloon up while crawling makes reflex integration enjoyable.

Remember, balloons aren't just for decoration! Blow one up if you're looking for a fun way to engage your family!

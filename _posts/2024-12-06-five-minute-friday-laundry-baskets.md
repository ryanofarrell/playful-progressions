## Heavy Work Benefits

Laundry baskets offer fantastic opportunities for heavy work activities at any age! Heavy work is renowned for providing proprioceptive input, crucial for self-regulation. Encourage your kids to pack a laundry basket with their favorite stuffed animals, blankets, and toys. The act of lifting and transporting these items provides excellent heavy work benefits. For younger ones, placing them in the laundry basket with toys can be both stimulating and enjoyable. Additionally, they can push or pull the basket, enhancing their motor skills. For older children, lifting the laundry basket itself provides a great proprioceptive workout.

## Vestibular Processing Benefits

Did you know that laundry baskets can double as makeshift vehicles? Place your child inside and gently push or pull them around the room. Add pillows or blankets for extra comfort and support. This activity not only provides vestibular input but also offers a fun sensory experience.

## Core Strengthening Benefits

Sitting in a moving laundry basket is an excellent way to improve core strength. Alternatively, use an upside-down laundry basket as a platform for your child to play on. This encourages them to maintain balance and engage their core muscles. For added difficulty, have your toddler kneel on a pillow while playing, adding an extra challenge to their core engagement.

## Fine Motor Benefits

Laundry baskets have holes that can be utilized for fine motor activities. Attach items like rubber bands, exercise bands, or party beads to these holes for your little one to manipulate. You can also tape a coloring page to the inside of the laundry basket, providing a unique drawing station. Not only does this keep them entertained in a safe space, but it also promotes optimal wrist extension and increases shoulder strength by utilizing a vertical surface.

By incorporating these activities, you can transform your laundry basket into a preferred play space for you and your child. Here's to making laundry time a little more enjoyable!

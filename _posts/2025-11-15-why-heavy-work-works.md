If you have a child who seems to be in constant motion—crashing into the sofa, jumping off furniture, or wrestling with everything in sight—you might feel like they just have too much energy. But as an OT (and a mom!), I see something else: a sensory system that is seeking input.

## What is Proprioception?

Proprioception is often called our "sixth sense". It tells our brain where our body parts are in space without us having to look at them. It's the reason you can touch your nose with your eyes closed or walk without staring at your feet.

For some kids, this internal map is a bit fuzzy. They seek out intense physical sensations—crashing, jumping, squeezing—to help their brain "feel" their body better. This input is organizing and calming for their nervous system.

## Enter: Heavy Work

"Heavy work" refers to any activity that pushes or pulls against the body. It provides resistance to the muscles and joints. Think about how good a big hug feels, or the satisfying feeling of carrying a heavy backpack. That deep pressure is calming.

When we give our kids opportunities for heavy work, we are feeding their sensory system exactly what it's hungry for, but in a safe and functional way. It releases calming chemicals in the brain that help with regulation and focus.

## Easy Heavy Work Ideas for Home

You don't need fancy equipment to incorporate heavy work into your day. Here are some of my favorite ways to get that good proprioceptive input:

*   **Laundry Basket Push:** Fill a laundry basket with books or toys and have your child push it across the room. We love [laundry baskets](/blog/five-minute-friday-laundry-baskets.html) around here because they are so versatile!
*   **Animal Walks:** Crab walk, bear walk, or frog jump from room to room. This is great for core strength too.
*   **Carrying Groceries:** Let them carry a heavy bag (safely!) from the car. It gives them a "job" and provides input.
*   **The Burrito Roll:** Wrap your child tightly in a blanket (head out!) and give them deep pressure squishes. [Blanket rides](/blog/five-minute-friday-blanket-rides.html) are another fun variation that combines movement with pressure.
*   **Wall Pushes:** Have them place their hands on the wall and try to "push the house over" for 10 seconds. This is a perfect "in the moment" strategy when things are escalating.

## When to Use It?

Heavy work is a magical tool for transitions. Is bedtime a struggle? Try some wall pushes or a burrito roll before pajamas. Is getting out the door for school chaotic? Have them carry their backpack to the car.

If you notice your child getting dysregulated or "wild", try redirecting them to a heavy work activity. Instead of saying "stop jumping on the couch", try asking "can you help me push this heavy box?". It changes the input from disorganized (jumping) to organized (pushing), which helps calm the body.

## Need More Support?

Every child's sensory system is unique. If you feel like you're constantly managing meltdowns or if your child's need for movement is impacting their daily life, it might be helpful to dig deeper.

I offer [Occupational Therapy Evaluations](/services/#evaluations) to help understand your child's specific sensory profile and create a plan that works for your family. Understanding the "why" behind the behavior changes everything!

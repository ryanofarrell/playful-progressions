It’s that time of year again! I can still remember the excitement of picking out school supplies and planning the perfect first-day outfit. But I also remember feeling overwhelmed and anxious about all the new things that come with a fresh school year.

Back-to-school transitions can be especially challenging for children with sensory differences. In previous years, they may have felt comfortable with their teachers, learned routines, and even begun to self-advocate. But starting a new school year means navigating unfamiliar environments, expectations, and sensory input—something that’s particularly tough for kids with sensory processing challenges.

To help ease the transition, it’s important for parents and teachers to stay mindful of what these children might be facing. Here are a few helpful tips from an occupational therapist to support a smoother back-to-school experience:

### 1. Start the Routine Early
Mornings can be tricky for children with sensory or executive functioning challenges. A week or so before school starts, try doing a “dress rehearsal” of your morning routine. Practice waking up, getting dressed, and going through grooming and breakfast routines at the same time each day.

**Helpful ideas:**
* Lay out clothes the night before.
* Use a checklist or visual schedule for grooming and dressing.
* Time how long each step takes to minimize surprises and morning stress.

### 2. Have a Sensory-Based Plan
Integrating sensory strategies into morning and afternoon routines can help regulate energy and mood.

In the morning, kids (and adults!) often need help waking up their bodies and sensory systems. Try incorporating movement-based activities like:
* Animal walks to the bathroom,
* Skipping to the breakfast table,
* Cross-lateral movements like windmills or cross crawls,
* Jumping or hopping instead of walking during transitions.

For example, do cross crawls as a family before sitting down to eat, or hop to the car instead of walking!

### 3. Manage Expectations
Uncertainty can be anxiety-provoking. Help your child feel more prepared by gathering as much information as possible before school starts:
* Who is the teacher?
* Who is in the class?
* What will the daily schedule look like?

Talk through the information using pictures or drawings and discuss what to expect. Even better if you can visit the classroom and teacher beforehand. This can ease anxiety during the first few days of school.

### 4. Prepare for a “Cool Down” After School
It's natural for parents to want to ask, “How was your day?” the moment kids get in the car—but that can feel overwhelming after a long, overstimulating day.

Instead, consider creating a "car kit" filled with sensory-friendly items your child can use on the way home. Use a small travel toiletry bag and fill it with things like:
* Putty or fidgets,
* Chewy tubes,
* Soft textured items.

Keep conversation minimal, and try playing calming music. Once home, offer access to a sensory space or calm-down corner to let your child decompress in a safe and familiar environment.

### 5. Continue Sensory Support into the Bedtime Routine
A restful night’s sleep is key to regulation the next day. Help prepare your child’s nervous system for rest with calming sensory input, such as:
* A warm bath,
* Soft blankets or weighted lap pads,
* Deep pressure massage,
* Dim lighting and calming music.

You can also reduce morning stress by packing lunches and laying out clothes the night before.

Wishing you and your child a smooth start to the school year! Implementing sensory strategies throughout the day can ease the transition for both children and parents—and set the tone for a successful year ahead.

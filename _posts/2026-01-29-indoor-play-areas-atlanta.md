I’m a big believer in outdoor play—for the sensory input, the fresh air, and the endless opportunities for movement. That said, I did not move to Atlanta to experience weeks of subfreezing temperatures. When it’s cold, dark, and everyone is bouncing off the walls, staying home with two young children who need movement to [regulate](/services/#treatments) is… not the vibe.

When we absolutely have to get out of the house, these are our five favorite indoor go-tos for cold days—places where kids can move their bodies and parents can breathe.

## 1. HippoHopp | [Brookhaven](/service-areas/)

[HippoHopp](https://hippohopp.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} is a staple for indoor play in Atlanta. With multiple bouncy houses, a large climbing structure, and a thoughtfully designed toddler area, this space works well for a wide range of ages. Parents can relax in seating areas or jump in and play alongside their kids (which mine always request).

From an OT perspective, Hippo Hopp provides excellent opportunities for **[proprioceptive input](/services/#treatments)**, **[vestibular movement](/services/#treatments)**, and **[motor planning](/services/#treatments)**. On busy days, the environment can feel overstimulating, but the staff is incredibly accommodating and often able to provide quieter space when party rooms are not in use.

**OT Tips:**
*   **Take Breaks:** Encourage your child to take movement breaks between bouncy houses to avoid sensory overload.
*   **Goal-Oriented Play:** Encourage goal-oriented play, such as creating an obstacle course in the big play area to reduce sensory overload.
*   **Regulation:** Use deep pressure (tight hugs, squeezes, or wall pushes) before leaving or frequently throughout the experience to support regulation.
*   **Timing:** Visit during off-peak hours if your child is sensitive to noise or crowds.

## 2. Atlanta History Center | [Buckhead](/service-areas/)

The [Atlanta History Center](https://www.atlantahistorycenter.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} features a newer child-friendly play area that offers something for nearly every age. Toddlers can explore giant foam blocks and open-ended play, while older children engage in multisensory exhibits—including a slide my daughter still talks about.

One of my favorite features is the cozy reading nook, which provides a natural sensory break. The craft area is always stocked with coloring, cutting, and fine motor activities, and the museum exhibits themselves offer a calm, low-stim environment that balances out higher-energy play.

**OT Tips:**
*   **Pacing:** Alternate between active play and quiet spaces to help your child stay regulated longer.
*   **Fine Motor Skills:** Encourage bilateral coordination during crafts (cutting, tearing, gluing).
*   **Heavy Work:** Use museum walking as "heavy work" by carrying bags or helping push doors open.

## 3. Fernbank Museum | Druid Hills

[Fernbank](https://www.fernbankmuseum.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} is a dream for kids who love dinosaurs, climbing, and hands-on learning. The large fossil exhibits immediately capture attention, while upstairs areas offer crafts, tangram puzzles, and a STEAM lab with microscopes and experiments.

The children’s area, **NatureQuest**, is where we spend most of our time. Rope bridges, climbing structures, slides, live animals, and interactive environments provide rich sensory and motor experiences. When it’s time to calm down, the exhibits outside the children’s area are quiet, dimly lit, and perfect for regulation. If weather allows, WildWoods and the Canopy Walk are worth bundling up for.

**OT Tips:**
*   **Strengthening:** Encourage climbing up slides or ladders to build strength and motor planning skills.
*   **Regulation Breaks:** Use the quiet exhibits as a built-in regulation break when the play area gets too loud.
*   **Body Awareness:** Practice body awareness by talking through where feet and hands go on rope bridges. If your child experiences gravitational insecurity, use deep pressure to regulate before and after exploring.

## 4. The Alliance Theatre | [Midtown](/service-areas/)

The [Alliance Theatre](https://alliancetheatre.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} recently opened PNC PlaySpace, a free indoor play experience for children ages 0–5. The current exhibit, *Bossa Nova Baby*, immerses children in a sensory-rich Brazilian rainforest environment designed for movement, exploration, and engagement.

Beyond PlaySpace, the Alliance offers outstanding child-friendly performances. These shows are intentionally designed for young audiences—movement is encouraged, seating is flexible, and children are invited to experience theater with their whole bodies. (Yes, this OT fully supports that.) I’ve even recommended their dinosaur show to [feeding clients](/services/#treatments) for its thoughtful exploration of sitting at the dinner table.

**OT Tips:**
*   **Child-Led Play:** Let children explore the space at their own pace—there’s no “right” way to play.
*   **Active Sitting:** Use performances to practice sitting with movement (wiggles are allowed!).
*   **Transitions:** Pair shows with PlaySpace time to meet sensory needs before sitting for a show.

## 5. Kids Empire | [Chamblee](/service-areas/)

[Kids Empire](https://www.kidsempire.com/park/plaza-fiesta){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} is a large indoor play space offering climbing, sliding, biking, dancing, and opportunities for safe risk-taking. The toddler area includes a big ball pit that provides excellent proprioceptive and tactile input, along with climbing and crawling challenges.

For children who become overwhelmed in busy environments, the space underneath the main play structure offers a calmer setting with oversized blocks and quieter play opportunities.

**OT Tips:**
*   **Body Listening:** Encourage children to notice when their bodies need a break.
*   **Balance:** Alternate high-energy play with building or quiet zones.
*   **Transitions:** Use transitions (snack, water, deep pressure) to support regulation before leaving.

## Final Thoughts from a Mom (and OT)

Winter can be tough, especially when your kids need movement to function. These indoor play spaces around Atlanta offer meaningful sensory experiences, opportunities for motor development, and ways for families to get out of the house without completely melting down.

I hope this list helps you make it through the colder months while building memories and regulation skills that last beyond the winter!

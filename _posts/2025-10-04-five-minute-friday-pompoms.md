Pom poms (or cotton balls!) are soft, colorful, and full of developmental potential. These tiny tools can support sensory, fine motor, and visual skills — and every activity takes less than 5 minutes to set up!

------

## Pom Poms for Babies

**Sensory exploration:** Gently rub pom poms along your baby’s arms, hands, legs, and especially feet. This helps them process touch sensations and build tolerance for different textures.

**Feeding foundations:** Lightly brushing the cheeks and corners of the mouth can help integrate the rooting reflex — an important step for developing feeding skills.

**Pom Pom Rescue:** Place pom poms in a muffin tin and let your baby grab them out. This supports early grasp development and problem solving. To make it harder, cover a few sections with tape!

## Pom Poms for Toddlers

**Tongs & sorting:** Use tongs to pick up and sort pom poms by color or size. Great for emerging grasp patterns, early scissor skills, and cognitive growth.

**Blow race:** Blow pom poms across a table or floor using a straw (or just your breath!) to strengthen oral motor and visual tracking skills.

**Pom Pom Rescue 2.0:** Hide pom poms under tape, inside containers, or behind small barriers — toddlers love the challenge!

**Mini erasers:** Use pom poms to erase chalk or dry erase boards. You can even stick one on the end of a marker to promote in-hand manipulation and tripod grasp.

**Citrus squeezer play:** Place pom poms inside a handheld citrus squeezer and have your toddler squeeze to pick them up or drop them into a cup. This builds fine motor strength, bilateral coordination, and hand endurance in a playful way!

## Pom Poms for Bigger Kids

**Pencil helper:** Tuck a small pom pom under the ring and pinky fingers to encourage a proper tripod grasp while writing.

**Feed the tennis ball:** Cut a “mouth” in a tennis ball and have your child squeeze it open with one hand while feeding pom poms inside with the other. This builds bilateral coordination, fine motor strength, and motor planning.

**Creative fun:** Use pom poms for crafting, color matching, or art projects — all great ways to boost tactile, visual-motor, and fine motor skills while having fun.

Quick, colorful, and full of developmental magic — pom poms are proof that sometimes the simplest toys make the biggest impact!

Babies by nature reach and grab everything they see (goodbye wearing your hair down). Instead of allowing your baby to pull out all of your luscious locks, try painters tape instead.

### Set up

Painters tape can be used on a variety of surfaces like a wall, tray, or even on a binder to provide a slanted surface. Tear a piece of tape about 5 inches long and tape it to your surface in horizontal or vertical lines leaving the bottom or side inch loose. Position your baby in front of the tape and demonstrate pulling the tape off the wall or whatever surface you use.

### Benefits of using painters tape

- Developing a pincer grasp - using the thumb and index fingers will strengthen babyâ€™s hands so that they can do more functional things like hold utensils and writing materials later on. Developing a pincer grasp is also essential in self feeding
- Crossing midline - placing the tape horizontally will encourage your baby to reach across the midline of their body, which is an essential skill necessary for bilateral coordination, eventually reading, and in short activating both sides of the brain
- Seated posture - sitting your baby in front of a vertical surface and allowing them to reach up to the tape will improve core strength and seated posture necessary for feeding readiness. Reaching overhead is also essential to develop upper extremity muscles
- Using a slanted surface (such as a binder) and placing it in front of baby in tummy time will encourage them to stay in tummy time longer, and lift their head against gravity
- Visual motor skill development - Babies must see the tape, then form a motor plan to get to it, thus improving visual motor integration skills. These foundational skills are essential for handwriting and drawing later on.

Enjoy this simple and fun activity with your little one! It can be repeated over and over again and never gets old!

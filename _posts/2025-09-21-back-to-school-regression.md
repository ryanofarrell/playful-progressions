Back-to-school season is officially over, but you might still be seeing some concerning changes in your child's behavior. Don't worry, you're not alone! Many parents report that their kids experience regressions—a temporary step back in skills they had already mastered—especially with things like toileting. It can be frustrating when everything was going so well, but it's a common and normal reaction to a major life change. Let's explore why this happens and what you can do to help.

## Understanding the "Why" Behind Regressions

Going back to school is a huge transition filled with new teachers, new schedules, and new demands. For many children, especially those with sensitive sensory systems, this can be incredibly overwhelming. Their little brains are working overtime to cope with this new environment. This can affect their ability to process internal signals, a skill called **interoception**.

Think of interoception as the body's internal GPS. It's how we know we're hungry, tired, or need to use the bathroom. When a child's sensory system is on overload, these internal signals can get mixed up or ignored, making it harder for them to recognize when they need to go.

A regression may also be a child's way of gaining a sense of control. At school, they have to follow specific rules and schedules. They are constantly being told what to do and when. Sometimes, the only thing they feel they have power over is their own body, including when (and if) to use the bathroom.

Finally, new environments are often a source of anxiety. A child who is used to a predictable routine at home might be afraid to ask for permission to use the restroom at school, especially if they are new to advocating for themselves.

## How to Help Your Child Through It

Here are some practical, gentle strategies you can use to support your child.

### If it's sensory-related...

Develop a sensory routine to help them manage overwhelm. Simple activities can make a big difference:

*   **Before school:** Have a quick dance party, do "animal walks" to the bathroom to brush teeth, or take a short walk outside.
*   **During the day (at home):** Teach your child simple, discreet ways to get sensory input, like "chair push-ups" (pushing their hands on the chair seat), squeezing their hands together, or a brief head shake.
*   **After school and before bed:** Continue with the sensory routine to help them unwind and regulate.

### To build interoception skills...

Help your child connect with their body's signals by talking about feelings and sensations. Narrate your own experiences: "I feel some pressure in my lower tummy, so I'm going to use the potty now." Talk about other feelings, too, like feeling happy after a morning hug or feeling tired after a long day. This helps them learn the language to describe their own internal sensations.

### To help with a need for control...

Dedicate just 10 minutes of uninterrupted, intentional time to your child each day. Let them choose the activity. This one-on-one time helps them feel seen and heard, which can boost emotional stability and reduce the need to control other areas of their life.

### Working with the school...

Talk to your child's teacher or school administrator. Find out what the bathroom break protocol is. Empower your child by letting them know you are working with the school to make them feel comfortable. In some cases, a little advocacy on your part might be necessary to ensure your child's needs are met.

## Remember to Stay Positive

Most importantly, avoid shaming your child. Meet them with encouragement and understanding. Pulling the plug on potty training or showing frustration can make the problem worse. Like most things in parenting, this is likely a short phase that will pass with a little patience and support. ❤️

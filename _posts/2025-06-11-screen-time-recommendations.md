As a pediatric OT—and a busy mom—I totally get it: sometimes you need screens to get something done. I’m not anti-screen. In fact, my kids watch the occasional show (hello, Ms. Rachel and Bluey!), especially when they’re sick or overtired. But screen time in our house is limited, and there are a few key guidelines I follow:

1. **Bigger Screens Are Better**
Yes, my husband agrees during football season! Watching TV on a larger screen (like a TV) helps avoid the fast-paced, disjointed clips often found on YouTube or phone apps. Unlike our childhood TV experience—where we waited for shows and sat through commercials—kids today can skip and scroll constantly, which fragments attention. Watching full episodes helps build attention span and narrative understanding, which are crucial for learning.

2. **There’s a Time and Place**
Boredom is a gift. It sparks creativity, problem-solving, and independent play. Just like we adults manage to-do lists, kids need opportunities to initiate and follow through with play. I recommend setting limits before the screen goes on: “You can watch one Bluey episode while I do the dishes. Then we’re building a Magnatile tower!” Avoid using screens as a distraction during meals, in restaurants, or at the grocery store. Those real-world experiences help kids process sensory input and build social-emotional skills.

3. **Choose Shows Wisely**
Not all kids' shows are created equal. Fast-paced, overstimulating programs like CoComelon or Hey Bear flood kids with sensory input that real life can’t match. When that becomes the norm, it’s hard for them to engage meaningfully in everyday play. Instead, opt for slower-paced shows with real people or simple storylines—think Sesame Street, Bluey, Little Bear.

4. **Model Healthy Tech Habits**
This one’s tough. Our lives are on our phones—but kids notice. If you're always on your phone, expect them to either fight for your attention or want screen time too. Try starting with screen-free family meals. More importantly, play with your kids. Making eye contact, sharing laughs, and being present goes a long way in building connection and social-emotional skills.

5. **Play Comes First**
At the end of the day, play is how kids learn. Movement, toys, art, and open-ended exploration support development in ways screens can’t. I’ve dedicated my career to understanding this—and I promise even the simplest play can have the biggest impact.

Welcome to 5 minute friday where I show you how to use simple household items for meaningful playbased activities for all ages, that take less than 5 minutes to set up. This week its straws! Head to my blog to see more and to identify the developmental benefits of each activity.

Straws are such a great go-to that I always carry in my therapy bag! They’re inexpensive, versatile, and effective for all ages! Here are a few things you can entertain your kiddos with using straws!

### Did you know that babies can start drinking from a straw cup early?

Introducing a straw cup when starting solids is a great way to support oral motor development and begin water intake alongside food. One of my favorites for beginners is the **Honey Bear Cup** 🐻. It has a flexible straw and a squeezable bottle, making it easier for little ones to learn how to drink from a straw.

I also love using silicone straws as teethers. Their long, stick-like design is perfect for mouthing and helps babies build jaw strength. You can even add a thin layer of nut butter (like peanut butter for early allergen introduction) or a bit of puree to encourage tongue lateralization—an important skill for feeding.

### Straws for Toddlers

Straws aren’t just for drinking—they’re versatile therapy tools too!

*   **✂️ Scissor practice:** Plastic straws are the perfect size and firmness for learning to snip. After cutting, the pieces can be used for stringing activities that build fine motor coordination, bilateral coordination, and visual motor skills.

*   **🔺 Shape building:** Those cut pieces can also be arranged into shapes, letters, or numbers for a fun, multisensory approach to pre-writing.

*   **💨 Oral motor play:** Place a cotton ball on the floor and have a race by blowing it with a straw. Add crawling into the mix, and you’ve got a great reflex integration activity too!

*   **🔧 Fine motor strengthening:** Try bending a straw into makeshift tongs—kids love the novelty, and it’s great for grasp development.

### Straws for Bigger Kids

Straws continue to be useful as children grow:

*   **🌬️ Bubble mountain:** Fill a bowl with water and a drop of soap, then blow through a straw to make a mountain of bubbles (just remind your child not to sip!). This activity strengthens oral motor skills, supports deep breathing for regulation, and encourages visual gaze.

*   **👀 Eye-hand coordination:** Hold a straw in your mouth, focus on the tip, and place small objects (like toothpicks) inside. This challenges both fine motor control and oculomotor skills, specifically convergence.

*   **🥤 Sensory support:** For sensory seekers, try sipping thick liquids (like smoothies or milkshakes) through a straw, or use a thinner straw (like a coffee stirrer) for water. Both options provide oral sensory input that can be calming and organizing.

### Final Thought

Straws are inexpensive, versatile, and easy to find—so grab a pack on your next trip to the dollar store and enjoy all the fun (and skill-building) they have to offer!

It’s summer BBQ season! Before you use up all your chip clips sealing bags of snacks, set a few aside for playtime—because these simple tools offer *amazing fine motor benefits*!

## Babies
Stick magnetic chip clips on the fridge to hold lightweight toys or fabric strips. This encourages babies to sit upright while reaching, building **core strength, postural control, and upper body engagement** — all through play!

## Young Kids
Turn your chip clips into pretend tongs! Have your child use them to pick up pom poms and sort them by color in a muffin tin. This builds **fine motor strength, coordination, and the open-close motion needed for scissor skills**.

You can also swap traditional game pieces for chip clips! Use them to pick up or move pieces in board games — it’s a great way to sneak in some extra hand strengthening.

Try attaching movement cards or visuals to a climbing rope or wall using a chip clip. This makes active play even more exciting — and adds a little surprise to each movement!

Working on **independence with dressing or hygiene tasks**? Clip a chip clip to your child’s waistband or shorts and challenge them to reach for it—great for practicing shoulder mobility and body awareness in a playful way.

## Big Kids
For older kids, chip clips can add extra challenge to familiar activities.

- Build a cup pyramid using chip clips instead of hands.
- Sort small objects using the clip upside down for extra resistance.
- Time the activity to add a fun competitive twist!

Enjoy these chip clip suggestions, and maybe some yummy summer snacks while you are at it!
